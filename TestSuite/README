This Test Suite ensures that the distributable version of SemRep matches our internal version.

runTest_<version>.sh - Script for testing of semrep.<version>.

To run the Test Suite, simply update the SEMREP_TEST variable in the file to
point to where your version of SemRep is located and the run

     ./runTest_<version>.sh

You will see locator notes scroll on the screen as the Test Suite proceeds
through its set of tests.  At the end, the script does a "diff" of the
"out" results file created by running this script and the corresponding standard
results file.  There should be no differences in the files.
