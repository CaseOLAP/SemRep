* Introduction

SemRep v1.7 is the third publicly available version of SemRep. 
The distribution includes the SemRep binary as well as the scripts that 
are needed to run the binary, the required libraries, data sets, and the test suite.

* Enhancements

Recent enhancements to SemRep include:

1. Sortal anaphora resolution: This feature has been significantly improved in 1.7 release. 

2. UMLS dataset options: We now provide the capability to run SemRep with 2015 dataset. 
To run SemRep with this release, use the options "-L 2015 -Z 2015AA". It is recommended that 
corresponding Lexicon and Metathesaurus releases are used (i.e., 2015 with 2015AA).

4. New EntrezGene data: SemRep v1.7 uses the EntrezGene DB snapshot from 10/23/2015.

5. Other: SemRep v1.7 also includes several small bug fixes and updates to semantic interpretation rules. The codebase has also been significantly refactored, but this should be transparent to the user.
