TI  - Platelet function monitoring with the Sonoclot analyzer after in vitro
      tirofiban and heparin administration.
PG  - 1314-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Reliable platelet function monitoring is desirable in patients
      treated with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors. The aim of the
      present laboratory-based study was to assess platelet function after
      administration of clinically relevant doses of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
      antagonist tirofiban with or without heparin by using Sonoclot (Sienco
      Inc) and platelet aggregometry. METHODS: Tirofiban (0-100 ng x mL(-1)) and
      heparin (0 or 1 U x mL(-1)) were added to blood samples obtained from 20
      healthy volunteers. Coagulation analysis was performed on citrated whole
      blood by using the Sonoclot analyzer. The glass bead-activated test and
      the new glass bead test with heparinase were used. The results were
      compared with adenosine-5'-diphosphate-activated platelet aggregometry.
      RESULTS: Administration of tirofiban showed a similar increase of platelet
      inhibition detected with the Sonoclot glass bead-activated test and glass
      bead test with heparinase, as well as by means of aggregometry. Bias
      between the different techniques was comparable; Spearman rank correlation
      was strong (glass bead-activated test vs aggregometry: rho = 0.823, P <
      .001; glass bead test with heparinase vs aggregometry: rho = 0.856, P <
      .001). After additional administration of heparin, platelet inhibition was
      only comparable for the glass bead test with heparinase and aggregometry,
      and the correlation coefficient remained unchanged for the glass bead test
      with heparinase versus aggregometry (rho = 0.878, P < .001). By contrast,
      the glass bead-activated test showed a nearly complete platelet inhibition
      with a significant bias compared with the glass bead test with heparinase
      and aggregometry. Correlation was weak for the glass bead-activated test
      versus aggregometry (rho = 0.407, P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: When compared
      with platelet aggregometry, the glass bead-activated test from Sonoclot
      reliably detects glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibition with tirofiban
      in unheparinized whole blood. However, in heparinized blood the glass bead
      test with heparinase is essential to accurately assess platelet function.

TI  - The emerging family of hepatoblastoma tumours: from ontogenesis to
      oncogenesis.
PG  - 1503-14
AB  - The identification of distinct types and subtypes of hepatoblastoma has
      led to a successful classification of these lesions. In recent years, and
      particularly within large tumour trials, the spectrum of paediatric
      epithelial liver tumours has increased. This, together with the need for
      defining clinically relevant risk groups, will require a new approach to
      defining and classifying these cancers. Furthermore, an impressive amount
      of molecular biological information on liver ontogenesis and growth
      regulation of hepatic tumours has recently accumulated, which will allow
      the development of a comprehensive classification system with particular
      emphasis on prognostics. In this review, novel findings relating to these
      issues are discussed.

TI  - Gene expression profiling identifies molecular subgroups among nodal
      peripheral T-cell lymphomas.
PG  - 1560-70
AB  - The classification of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) is still a matter
      of debate. To establish a molecular classification of PTCL, we analysed 59
      primary nodal T-cell lymphomas using cDNA microarrays, including 56 PTCL
      and three T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). The expression profiles could
      discriminate angioimmunoblastic lymphoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
      and T-LBL. In contrast, cases belonging to the broad category of 'PTCL,
      unspecified' (PTCL-U) did not share a single molecular profile. Using a
      multiclass predictor, we could separate PTCL-U into three molecular
      subgroups called U1, U2 and U3. The U1 gene expression signature included
      genes known to be associated with poor outcome in other tumors, such as
      CCND2. The U2 subgroup was associated with overexpression of genes
      involved in T-cell activation and apoptosis, including NFKB1 and BCL-2.
      The U3 subgroup was mainly defined by overexpression of genes involved in
      the IFN/JAK/STAT pathway. It comprised a majority of histiocyte-rich PTCL
      samples. Gene Ontology annotations revealed different functional profile
      for each subgroup. These results suggest the existence of distinct
      subtypes of PTCL-U with specific molecular profiles, and thus provide a
      basis to improve their classification and to develop new therapeutic
      targets.

TI  - Large-scale and high-confidence proteomic analysis of human seminal
      plasma.
PG  - R40
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of mass spectrometric (MS) techniques now
      allows the investigation of very complex protein mixtures ranging from
      subcellular structures to tissues. Body fluids are also popular targets of
      proteomic analysis because of their potential for biomarker discovery.
      Seminal plasma has not yet received much attention from the proteomics
      community but its characterization could provide a future reference for
      virtually all studies involving human sperm. The fluid is essential for
      the survival of spermatozoa and their successful journey through the
      female reproductive tract. RESULTS: Here we report the high-confidence
      identification of 923 proteins in seminal fluid from a single individual.
      Fourier transform MS enabled parts per million mass accuracy, and two
      consecutive stages of MS fragmentation allowed confident identification of
      proteins even by single peptides. Analysis with GoMiner annotated
      two-thirds of the seminal fluid proteome and revealed a large number of
      extracellular proteins including many proteases. Other proteins originated
      from male accessory glands and have important roles in spermatozoan
      survival. CONCLUSION: This high-confidence characterization of seminal
      plasma content provides an inventory of proteins with potential roles in
      fertilization. When combined with quantitative proteomics methodologies,
      it should be useful for studies of fertilization, male infertility, and
      prostatic and testicular cancers.

TI  - Modern management of obstructive salivary gland disease.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the results of a minimally invasive approach to the
      management of obstructive salivary gland disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Five hundred and thirty-seven patients with symptomatic obstructive
      salivary gland disease (455 calculi, 82 strictures) consisting of 330
      submandibular and 207 parotid cases were treated using minimally invasive
      techniques. Extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ECSWL),
      fluoroscopically guided basket retrieval, or intra-oral stone removal
      under general anaesthesia, were used for salivary calculi, either alone or
      in combination. Strictures were treated using fluoroscopically guided
      balloon dilatation. RESULTS: ECSWL achieved complete success (stone and
      symptom free) in 87/221 (39%) of cases (84/218 primary, 3/3 secondary) of
      which submandibular 43/131, parotid 44/90. Basket retrieval cured 124/166
      (75%) cases (103/136 primary, 21/30 secondary) of which submandibular
      80/109, parotid 44/57. Intra-oral surgical removal provided a cure in a
      further 137/143 (96%) submandibular cases (99/101 primary, 36/38 secondary
      and 2/4 tertiary). The overall success rate for the three techniques was
      348/455 (76%). Balloon dilatation resulted in complete elimination of the
      stricture in 44/82 (54%) and a reduction in the stricture in 32/82 (39%)
      and no improvement in 6/82 (7%). Review at six months showed resolution
      14/32 (44%), improvement 16/32 (50%) and no change 2/32 (6%) of symptoms.
      CONCLUSIONS: A minimally invasive approach to the management of
      obstructive salivary gland disease is to be encouraged. All four
      techniques described have a low morbidity and afford the possibility of
      retaining a functional gland.

TI  - [Drug interactions in an elderly population. Prospective assessment of
      their frequency and seriousness among 56 patients].
PG  - 837-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the nature and the number of potential adverse drug
      interactions by analysis of outpatient prescriptions for elderly patients,
      of medications taken during the week before hospitalization in a general
      surgery department. METHOD: The study of 56 patients older than 65 years
      was conducted from November 2002 through February 2003. The outpatient
      prescriptions corresponding to medications taken during the 7 days before
      admission were analyzed by a pharmacy resident, who used data-processing
      tools and databases. RESULTS: Most patients (83%) knew the reason for
      their prescription. Thirteen (28%) reported using over-the-counter
      medication. Only 89% of the patients reported complete compliance with the
      prescription. The average age of the patients was 72.1 +/- 6.3 years and
      the median was 71 years [65-91]; 43% were women and 57% men. The 257 lines
      of prescriptions analyzed averaged 5.7 +/- 2.6 drugs (range: 2-10) per
      prescription. The average number of possible interactions was 3.1 +/- 2.8
      per prescription for a total of 89 listed potential interactions. The
      levels observed were 3 warnings (3%), 37 precautions (42%) and 49 possible
      adverse interactions (55%). No contraindication was noted. The drugs
      mentioned most often were benzodiazepines, diuretics, conversion enzyme
      inhibitors, angiotensin II inhibitors, and beta-blockers. The potential
      risks most often found were hypotension, depression of the central nervous
      system, hypoglycemia and acute renal failure. The drug interactions were
      mainly due to the accumulation of the effects of separate drug classes.
      Deterioration in renal function was often noted as plasma concentration of
      the second drug increased. DISCUSSION: This exploratory study shows the
      reality of the iatrogenic risk for elderly patients. This analysis of
      outpatient prescriptions is consistent with findings in the literature.
      Analysis of interactions is conducted on a pairwise basis. It is thus
      difficult to envisage the consequences of the association of 5 or more
      drugs in patients with complex illnesses and diminished physiological and
      metabolic capacity. Patient files kept by the pharmacist could provide
      information about individual combinations ofthe prescription and
      over-the-counter drugs.

TI  - Concomitant fractures of the acetabulum and spine: a retrospective review
      of over 300 patients.
PG  - 609-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence and spectrum of concomitant acetabulum and spine
      trauma has not been clearly defined. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed
      307 acetabulum fracture patients over 5 years, and evaluated this cohort
      for concomitant spine injuries. Patient and injury demographics, spine and
      neurologic injury and delay in diagnosis were examined. RESULTS: Complete
      data were available for 275 (90%) of the cohort, and 55 spine injuries (54
      fractures and 1 traumatic disc herniation) were identified in 34 patients.
      Thus, the incidence of concomitant acetabulum and spine fractures was
      approximately 13% (34 of 275). Four percent of the patients sustained
      significant thoracolumbar fractures (burst, flexion-distraction, or
      dislocation). An average 8.6-day delay in diagnosis occurred in three
      spine fracture patients. One suffered progressive neurologic injury.
      CONCLUSIONS: It is essential that the traumatologists have a high index of
      suspicion for spine injury, particularly thoracolumbar injury in patients
      who sustain fractures of the acetabulum. We recommend early thoracolumbar
      computed tomography imaging in patients with fractures of the acetabulum
      if plain radiographs are not possible or inadequate.

TI  - Dopamine D3 receptors regulate GABAA receptor function through a
      phospho-dependent endocytosis mechanism in nucleus accumbens.
PG  - 2513-21
AB  - The dopamine D3 receptor, which is highly enriched in nucleus accumbens
      (NAc), has been suggested to play an important role in reinforcement and
      reward. To understand the potential cellular mechanism underlying D3
      receptor functions, we examined the effect of D3 receptor activation on
      GABAA receptor (GABAAR)-mediated current and inhibitory synaptic
      transmission in medium spiny neurons of NAc. Application of PD128907
      [(4aR,10bR)-3,4a,4,10b-tetrahydro-4-propyl-2H,5H-[1]benzopyrano-[4,3-b]-1,
      4-oxazin-9-ol hydrochloride], a specific D3 receptor agonist, caused a
      significant reduction of GABAAR current in acutely dissociated NAc neurons
      and miniature IPSC amplitude in NAc slices. This effect was blocked by
      dialysis with a dynamin inhibitory peptide, which prevents the
      clathrin/activator protein 2 (AP2)-mediated GABAA receptor endocytosis. In
      addition, the D3 effect on GABAAR current was prevented by agents that
      manipulate protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Infusion of a peptide derived
      from GABAAR beta subunits, which contains an atypical binding motif for
      the clathrin AP2 adaptor complex and the major PKA phosphorylation sites
      and binds with high affinity to AP2 only when dephosphorylated, diminished
      the D3 regulation of IPSC amplitude. The phosphorylated equivalent of the
      peptide was without effect. Moreover, PD128907 increased GABAAR
      internalization and reduced the surface expression of GABAA receptor beta
      subunits in NAc slices, which was prevented by dynamin inhibitory peptide
      or cAMP treatment. Together, our results suggest that D3 receptor
      activation suppresses the efficacy of inhibitory synaptic transmission in
      NAc by increasing the phospho-dependent endocytosis of GABAA receptors.

TI  - Chronic fatigue syndrome: exercise performance related to immune
      dysfunction.
PG  - 1647-54
AB  - PURPOSE: To date, the exact cause of abnormal exercise response in chronic
      fatigue syndrome (CFS) remains to be revealed, but evidence addressing
      intracellular immune deregulation in CFS is growing. Therefore, the aim of
      this cross-sectional study was to examine the interactions between several
      intracellular immune variables and exercise performance in CFS patients.
      METHODS: After venous blood sampling, subjects (16 CFS patients) performed
      a maximal exercise stress test on a bicycle ergometer with continuous
      monitoring of cardiorespiratory variables. The following immune variables
      were assessed: the ratio of 37 kDa Ribonuclease (RNase) L to the 83 kDa
      native RNase L (using a radiolabeled ligand/receptor assay), RNase L
      enzymatic activity (enzymatic assay), protein kinase R activity assay
      (comparison Western blot), elastase activity (enzymatic-colorimetric
      assay), the percent of monocytes, and nitric oxide determination (for
      monocytes and lymphocytes; flow cytometry, live cell assay). RESULTS:
      Forward stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed 1) that elastase
      activity was the only factor related to the reduction in oxygen uptake at
      a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of 1.0 (regression model: R = 0.53, F
      (1,14) = 15.5, P < 0.002; elastase activity P < 0.002); 2) that the
      protein kinase R activity was the principle factor related to the
      reduction in workload at RER = 1.0; and 3) that elastase activity was the
      principle factor related to the reduction in percent of target heart rate
      achieved. CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence for an association
      between intracellular immune deregulation and exercise performance in
      patients with CFS. To establish a causal relationship, further study of
      these interactions using a prospective longitudinal design is required.

TI  - Derivation of the children's head injury algorithm for the prediction of
      important clinical events decision rule for head injury in children.
PG  - 885-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: A quarter of all patients presenting to emergency departments
      are children. Although there are several large, well-conducted studies on
      adults enabling accurate selection of patients with head injury at high
      risk for computed tomography scanning, no such study has derived a rule
      for children. AIM: To conduct a prospective multicentre diagnostic cohort
      study to provide a rule for selection of high-risk children with head
      injury for computed tomography scanning. DESIGN: All children presenting
      to the emergency departments of 10 hospitals in the northwest of England
      with any severity of head injury were recruited. A tailor-made proforma
      was used to collect data on around 40 clinical variables for each child.
      These variables were defined from a literature review, and a pilot study
      was conducted before the children's head injury algorithm for the
      prediction of important clinical events (CHALICE) study. All children who
      had a clinically significant head injury (death, need for neurosurgical
      intervention or abnormality on a computed tomography scan) were
      identified. Recursive partitioning was used to create a highly sensitive
      rule for the prediction of significant intracranial pathology. RESULTS:
      22,772 children were recruited over 2 1/2 years. 65% of these were boys
      and 56% were <5 years old. 281 children showed an abnormality on the
      computed tomography scan, 137 had a neurosurgical operation and 15 died.
      The CHALICE rule was derived with a sensitivity of 98% (95% confidence
      interval (CI) 96% to 100%) and a specificity of 87% (95% CI 86% to 87%)
      for the prediction of clinically significant head injury, and requires a
      computed tomography scan rate of 14%. CONCLUSION: A highly sensitive
      clinical decision rule is derived for the identification of children who
      should undergo computed tomography scanning after head injury. This rule
      has the potential to improve and standardise the care of children
      presenting with head injuries. Validation of this rule in new cohorts of
      patients should now be undertaken.

      proteins, nucleic acids and glycoproteins in healthy cattle and in that
      affected with leukosis].
PG  - 261-79
AB  - The occurrence of chalones has been studied in the liver, spleen and lymph
      nodes of cattle. The cells of those organs were fractionated. After
      removing the nuclei and mitochondria the residue was subdivided by means
      of the cesium chloride gradient into smooth and rough microsomes. The
      chalones were investigated in supernatants from these two groups of
      microsomes. In the obtained supernatants, the levels of proteins, nucleic
      acids and glycoproteins were estimated. The protein composition was
      analysed by means of disc electrophoresis on polyacrylamide, and the
      antigenic relationship of these proteins with the serum ones was studied
      using immunoelectrophoresis. The biological value of the separated
      fractions was investigated by means of the mitosis inhibition test in
      mice. The experimental groups of these animals were injected
      intraperitoneally with different cellular subfractions without or with
      colcemide. The control groups were treated with colcemide only or with
      physiological solution of NaCl. The subcellular fractions were separated
      from the tissues of healthy cattle and of that affected with leukosis. It
      was found that a protein showing chalone activity appears in all cellular
      subfractions derived from the tissues of healthy animals; its highest
      concentration was found in the supernatants from rough microsomes of the
      spleen and from smooth microsomes of the lymph nodes. The antimitotic
      effect was observed at the concentration of 100-200 microg of protein in
      0.1 ml. This effect seems to be connected with glycoproteins. In the
      supernatants from tissues of leukotic animals, there was observed a
      decrease of the antimitotic effect. A mixture of proteins was present in
      the supernatants, which was demonstrated by means of polyacrylamide
      electrophoresis. These proteins showed and antigenic relationship with the
      proteins of blood serum. This can be concluded from their precipitation
      with the sera against the bovine serum proteins in the
      immunoelectrophoresis test. The chalone of the spleen seems to be
      different from that of the lymph nodes. The experiment showed the
      occurrence of an antimitotic effect with the non-homologous proteins, i.e.
      the chalone from the liver inhibited the mitotic divisions of the cells of
      the spleen, thymus and lymph nodes in mice. In this experiment, a mixture
      of proteins was used. The purification of an active chalone will be the
      subject of further investigations.

TI  - Adding in vivo quantitative 1H MR spectroscopy to improve diagnostic
      accuracy of breast MR imaging: preliminary results of observer performance
      study at 4.0 T.
PG  - 465-75
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the addition of in vivo quantitative
      hydrogen 1 (1H) magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy can improve the
      radiologist's diagnostic accuracy in interpreting breast MR images to
      distinguish benign from malignant lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      study was approved by the institutional review board and, where
      appropriate, was compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act. All patients provided written informed consent.
      Fifty-five breast MR imaging cases-one lesion each in 55 patients aged
      24-66 years with biopsy-confirmed findings-were retrospectively evaluated
      by four radiologists. Patients were examined with contrast
      material-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted 4.0-T MR imaging. The
      concentration of total choline-containing compounds (tCho) was quantified
      by using single-voxel 1H MR spectroscopy. For each case, the radiologists
      were asked to give the percentage probability of malignancy, the Breast
      Imaging and Reporting Data System category, and a recommendation for
      patient treatment. Two interpretations were performed for each case: The
      initial interpretation was based on the lesion's morphologic features and
      time-signal intensity curve, and the second interpretation was based on
      the lesion's morphologic features, time-signal intensity curve, and tCho
      concentration. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Wilcoxon signed
      rank, kappa statistic, and accuracy (based on the area under the ROC
      curve) analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 55 lesions evaluated, 35
      were invasive carcinomas and 20 were benign. The addition of 1H MR
      spectroscopy resulted in higher sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and
      interobserver agreement for all four radiologists. More specifically, two
      of the four radiologists achieved a significant improvement in sensitivity
      (P=.03, P=.03), and all four radiologists achieved a significant
      improvement in accuracy (P = .01, P = .05, P = .009, P < .001).
      CONCLUSION: Current study results suggest that the addition of
      quantitative 1H MR spectroscopy to the breast MR imaging examination may
      help to improve the radiologist's ability to distinguish benign from
      malignant breast lesions.

TI  - RhoGTPases and p53 are involved in the morphological appearance and
      interferon-alpha response of hairy cells.
PG  - 562-73
AB  - Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon B-cell lymphoproliferative disease of
      unknown etiology in which tumor cells display characteristic
      microfilamentous membrane projections. Another striking feature of the
      disease is its exquisite sensitivity to interferon (IFN)-alpha. So far,
      none of the known IFN-alpha regulatory properties have explained IFN-alpha
      responsiveness nor have they taken into account the morphological
      characteristics of hairy cells. IFN-alpha profoundly alters cytoskeletal
      organization of hairy cells and causes reversion of the hairy appearance
      into a rounded morphology. Because cytoskeletal rearrangements are
      controlled by the Rho family of GTPases, we investigated the GTPase
      activation status in hairy cells and their regulation by IFN-alpha. Using
      immunolocalization techniques and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that
      hairy cells display high levels of active Cdc42 and Rac1 and that
      IFN-alpha down-regulates these activities. In sharp contrast, RhoA
      activity was low in hairy cells but was increased by IFN-alpha treatment.
      Finally, IFN-alpha-mediated morphological changes also implicated a
      p53-induced response. These observations shed light on the mechanism of
      action of IFN-alpha in hairy cell leukemia and are of potential relevance
      for the therapeutical applications of this cytokine.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms involved in transcriptional activation of the human
      Sia-alpha2,3-Gal-beta1,4-GlcNAc-R:alpha2,8-sialyltransferase (hST8Sia III)
      gene induced by KCl in human glioblastoma cells.
PG  - 1057-64
AB  - In the present study, we have shown that KCl known as an inducer for
      differentiation of neuronal cells increases the human
      Sia-alpha2,3-Gal-beta1,4-GlcNAc-R:alpha2,8-sialyltransferase (hST8Sia III)
      gene transcription via phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI-3K) in glioblastoma
      U-87MG cells. The induction of hST8Sia III by KCl is regulated at the
      transcriptional level in a dose- and time-dependent manner as evidenced by
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To elucidate the
      mechanism underlying the regulation of hST8Sia III gene expression in
      U-87MG cells induced by KCl, we characterized the promoter region of the
      hST8Sia III gene. Functional analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the
      hST8Sia III gene by the transient expression method showed that the -1194
      to -816 region functions as the KCl-inducible promoter in U-87MG cells.
      Furthermore, as evidenced by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, KCl-induced
      expression of hST8Sia III gene was dependent on the PI-3K signal
      transduction pathway during the neuronal differentiation of U-87 cells, as
      an increase in beta-tubulin III known as a neuronal differentiation marker
      was observed. In KCl-depolarization on U-87 cells, the PI-3K-dependent
      promoter activation at the -1194 to -816 region up-regulated expression of
      hST8Sia III gene. These results suggest that the expression of hST8Sia III
      gene via the PI-3K signaling pathway is enhanced during KCl-induced
      differentiation of U-87 cells by increasing expression of beta-tubulin
      III.

TI  - Endoscopically-assisted resection of a choroid plexus vascular
      malformation traversing the cerebral aqueduct: technical case report.
PG  - ONS-E161; discussion ONS-E161
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report a case of a choroid plexus vascular malformation of
      the cerebral aqueduct, third, and fourth ventricles of an adolescent
      female that was resected with endoscopic assistance. CLINICAL
      PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old girl presented with a 1-week history of
      headaches and emesis. A noncontrasted computed tomographic scan of the
      head demonstrated enlarged lateral and third ventricles. Subsequent
      magnetic resonance imaging scans with and without contrast revealed an
      enhancing mass originating in the third ventricle, traversing the cerebral
      aqueduct, and terminating in the fourth ventricle. RESULTS: We used a
      suboccipital approach to remove the vascular malformation after
      endoscopically disconnecting it from its feeding and draining vessels in
      the third ventricle. Total excision was performed. Postoperative magnetic
      resonance imaging scans and arteriograms confirmed complete resection of
      the vascular malformation. CONCLUSION: Choroid plexus vascular
      malformations can exist intraventricularly and can be confused with a
      neoplasm. Resection of these intraventricular lesions can be performed
      with endoscopic assistance.

TI  - Prevalence of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance and the role of resistance
      algorithms: data from seroconverters in the CASCADE collaboration from
      1987 to 2003.
PG  - 505-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine factors influencing the rate of transmitted drug
      resistance (TDR) among seroconverters, with particular emphasis on 3
      widely used genotypic drug resistance algorithms. METHODS: The study used
      data from CASCADE (Concerted Action on Seroconversion to AIDS and Death in
      Europe), a collaboration of seroconverter cohorts in Europe and Canada.
      Genotypic resistance data were derived within 18 months of the last
      seronegative test or date of laboratory evidence of acute infection and
      before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. The Stanford algorithm
      was used to analyze each individual's nucleotide sequence. A multivariate
      logistic model was used to assess independent relationships between the
      presence of TDR and exposure category, sex, age at seroconversion, and
      year of seroconversion. The paper also describes 3 alternative definitions
      of resistance: the Stanford algorithm, the key resistance mutations
      defined by the International AIDS Society, and the Agence Nationale de
      Recherches sur le Sida (ANRS) algorithm. RESULTS: Forty-five of 438
      patients (10.3%) seroconverting between 1987 and 2003 were infected with a
      drug-resistant HIV-1 variant. Forty patients (9.1%) showed resistance
      mutations to only 1 class of antiretroviral drugs, 2 (0.5%) to 2 classes,
      and 3 (0.7%) to 3 classes of antiretroviral therapy. It was suggested that
      individuals seroconverting later in calendar time were more likely to have
      TDR (relative risk 3.89 and 95% CI: 0.84 to 18.02, and relative risk 4.69
      and 95% CI: 1.03 to 21.31, for 1996-1999 and 2000-2003, respectively,
      compared with pre-1996; P trend = 0.08). This trend was apparent
      regardless of the definition of TDR used. The total estimated proportion
      of individuals with TDR varied between 10.3% and 15.5% according to which
      definition was used. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence was found for the rise of TDR
      over time. A specific definition of what constitutes TDR rather than a
      simple list of mutations is needed.

      These properties were compared with the same parameters obtained for the
      water-soluble and liposomal diminazene aceturate drug forms. The drug
      forms studied may be arranged in the following order of decreasing
      effectiveness of accumulation of diminazene in red and white blood cells
      and in murine organs: liposome form, micellar form, and water-soluble
      form.

TI  - Lack of expression of the EP2 but not EP3 receptor for prostaglandin E2
      results in suppression of skin tumor development.
PG  - 9304-11
AB  - The EP2 receptor for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a membrane receptor that
      mediates at least part of the action of PGE2. It has been shown that EP2
      plays a critical role in tumorigenesis in mouse mammary gland and colon.
      However, the possibility that the EP2 receptor is involved in the
      development of skin tumors was unknown. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate the role of the EP2 receptor in mouse skin carcinogenesis.
      Unlike EP3 knockout mice, the EP2 knockout mice produced significantly
      fewer tumors and reduced tumor incidence compared with wild type (WT) mice
      in a 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
      (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) two-stage carcinogenesis
      protocol. EP2 knockout mice had significantly reduced cellular
      proliferation of mouse skin keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro compared
      with that in WT mice. In addition, the epidermis of EP2 knockout mice 48
      hours after topical TPA treatment was significantly thinner compared with
      that of WT mice. The inflammatory response to TPA was reduced in EP2
      knockout mice, based on a reduced number of macrophages in the dermis and
      a reduced level of interleukin-1alpha mRNA expression, compared with WT
      mice. EP2 knockout mice also had significantly reduced epidermal cyclic
      AMP levels after PGE2 treatment compared with WT mice. Tumors from WT mice
      produced more blood vessels and fewer apoptotic cells than those of EP2
      knockout mice as determined by immunohistochemical staining. Our data
      suggest that the EP2 receptor plays a significant role in the
      protumorigenic action of PGE2 in skin tumor development.

TI  - Sopoongsan inhibits mast cell-mediated anaphylactic reactions and
      inflammatory cytokine secretion.
PG  - 31-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mast cells are key effector cells in the early-phase allergic
      inflammation and in diverse immunological and pathological processes.
      Sopoongsan (SPS), a traditional Korean medicine, has been used as
      therapeutics for allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD). The
      precise effect in experimental models of SPS, however, remains unknown. In
      this report, we investigated the effect of SPS on mast cell-mediated
      anaphylactic reactions and cytokine production in in vivo and in vitro
      murine models. METHODS: Compound 48/80-induced histamine and ear swelling
      were measured with the various concentrations of SPS. The amount of dye
      was determined colorimetrically after antidinitrophenyl IgE
      antibody-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction. Secretion of
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-6 in
      supernatants from HMC-1 cells was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. The expression level of nuclear factor
      (NF)-kappaB/Rel A in the nucleus and the activation of mitogen-activated
      protein kinases (MAPKs) were examined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS:
      SPS inhibited the degranulation and histamine release from the rat
      peritoneal mast cells activated by compound 48/80. Compound 48/80-induced
      ear swelling was significantly reduced. SPS also showed an inhibitory
      effect of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction. Significantly reduced
      levels (p < 0.05) of TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-6 were observed in the human
      mast cell line with SPS and SPS components. In addition, SPS inhibited an
      increase of NF-kappaB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
      activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SPS has an inhibitory
      effect on atopic allergic reaction and this might be useful for the
      clinical application to treat allergic diseases such as AD.

TI  - MR and fluorescent imaging of low-density lipoprotein receptors.
PG  - 1251-9
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Over-expression of low-density lipoprotein
      receptors (LDLRs) occurs in many types of malignancies and is related to
      the requirement for lipids for rapid proliferation of the tumors. On the
      other hand, LDLRs that are unable to bind LDL are found on hepatocytes of
      patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disease that
      leads to premature atherosclerosis and death. The highly selective binding
      of LDL to LDLR makes these particles ideal carriers of therapeutic and
      diagnostic contrast agents into the targeted cells. The objectives of this
      paper are to examine whether a prototype contrast agent (PTIR267) with
      dual detection properties is suitable for labeling of LDL particles for in
      vivo detection of LDLR by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and for in
      vitro monitoring of cellular localization by confocal fluorescence
      microscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PTIR267 is a lipophilic GdDTPA
      derivative conjugated to a fluorescent dye. The conjugated dye molecule
      makes the probe sufficiently water soluble to allow labeling of LDL by a
      brief incubation of LDL with PTIR267 dissolved in PBS at 37 degrees C
      (mole ratio LDL: PTIR267 = 0.09:1). The molar relaxivity of PTIR267 in
      saline is 26 mM(-1)s(-1). Specific LDLR-mediated uptake of PTIR267-labeled
      LDL was demonstrated in vitro by confocal fluorescence imaging of B16
      melanoma cells using confocal fluorescence imaging. In vivo uptake of
      PTIR267-labeled LDL by a subcutaneously implanted B16 melanoma in mice
      leads to 30% decrease in longitudinal relaxation time (T(1)) in the tumor.
      In vivo uptake of PTIR267-labeled LDL leads to 70% decrease in T(1) in a
      normal C57BL/6 mouse liver; however, in the liver of LDL receptor gene
      knockout (LDLr-/-) mice with C57BL/6 background, only 12% decrease in T(1)
      is observed. CONCLUSIONS: The dual fluorescence and MR imaging properties
      of PTIR267, combined with the ease of LDL labeling, suggest that it will
      be a useful tool for optimization of LDLR-targeted cancer diagnosis or
      therapy and for monitoring the efficacy of gene therapy of FH.

TI  - Somatic mtDNA mutations cause aging phenotypes without affecting reactive
      oxygen species production.
PG  - 17993-8
AB  - The mitochondrial theory of aging proposes that reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) generated inside the cell will lead, with time, to increasing
      amounts of oxidative damage to various cell components. The main site for
      ROS production is the respiratory chain inside the mitochondria and
      accumulation of mtDNA mutations, and impaired respiratory chain function
      have been associated with degenerative diseases and aging. The theory
      predicts that impaired respiratory chain function will augment ROS
      production and thereby increase the rate of mtDNA mutation accumulation,
      which, in turn, will further compromise respiratory chain function.
      Previously, we reported that mice expressing an error-prone version of the
      catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase accumulate a substantial burden of
      somatic mtDNA mutations, associated with premature aging phenotypes and
      reduced lifespan. Here we show that these mtDNA mutator mice accumulate
      mtDNA mutations in an approximately linear manner. The amount of ROS
      produced was normal, and no increased sensitivity to oxidative
      stress-induced cell death was observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from
      mtDNA mutator mice, despite the presence of a severe respiratory chain
      dysfunction. Expression levels of antioxidant defense enzymes, protein
      carbonylation levels, and aconitase enzyme activity measurements indicated
      no or only minor oxidative stress in tissues from mtDNA mutator mice. The
      premature aging phenotypes in mtDNA mutator mice are thus not generated by
      a vicious cycle of massively increased oxidative stress accompanied by
      exponential accumulation of mtDNA mutations. We propose instead that
      respiratory chain dysfunction per se is the primary inducer of premature
      aging in mtDNA mutator mice.

TI  - Replacement arthroplasty versus internal fixation for extracapsular hip
      fractures in adults.
PG  - CD000086
AB  - BACKGROUND: Internal fixation, commonly used for extracapsular hip
      fractures, may fail particularly in unstable fractures. Replacement of the
      hip using arthroplasty, often used for intracapsular fractures, has been
      used as an alternative. OBJECTIVES: To compare replacement arthroplasty
      with internal fixation for the treatment of extracapsular hip fractures in
      adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle
      Trauma Group Specialised Register (December 2005), the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005),
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, the UK National Research Register, several orthopaedic
      journals, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing
      replacement arthroplasty with an internal fixation implant for adults with
      an extracapsular hip fracture. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both review
      authors independently assessed 10 aspects of trial quality and extracted
      data. We requested additional information from trial investigators. Where
      appropriate, limited pooling of data was performed. MAIN RESULTS: Two
      randomised controlled trials including a total of 148 people aged 70 years
      or over with unstable extracapsular hip fractures in the trochanteric
      region were identified and included in this review. Both had
      methodological limitations, including inadequate assessment of longer-term
      outcome. One trial compared a cemented arthroplasty with a sliding hip
      screw. This found no significant differences between the two methods of
      treatment for operating time, local wound complications, mechanical
      complications, reoperation, mortality or loss of independence of
      previously independent patients at one year. There was, however, a higher
      blood transfusion need in the arthroplasty group. The other trial compared
      a cementless arthroplasty versus a proximal femoral nail. It also found a
      higher blood transfusion need in the arthroplasty group, together with a
      greater operative blood loss, and a longer length of surgery. There were
      no significant differences between the two interventions for mechanical
      complications, local wound complications, reoperation, general
      complications, mortality at one year or long-term function. None of the
      pooled outcome data yielded statistically significant differences between
      the arthroplasty and internal fixation, with the exception of the
      significantly higher numbers of participants in the arthroplasty group
      requiring blood transfusion (relative risk 1.71, 95% confidence interval
      1.05 to 2.77). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence from
      randomised trials to determine whether replacement arthroplasty has any
      advantage over internal fixation for extracapsular hip fractures. Further
      larger well-designed randomised trials comparing arthroplasty versus
      internal fixation for the treatment of unstable fractures are required.

PG  - 183-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbial characteristics of patients with pelvic
      inflammatory disease (PID) and the possible impact of an intrauterine
      device (IUD) on the microbial environment in women presenting with PID.
      METHODS: Case-control study, investigating 51 women with acute PID and 50
      healthy women. Endocervical specimens for microbiological investigation
      were obtained at gynaecological examination. RESULTS: IUD users with PID
      had significantly more Fusobacteria spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. than
      non-IUD users with PID. The finding of combinations of several anaerobic
      or aerobic microbes was associated with a significantly increased risk of
      PID and with complicated PID. In IUD users, the combinations of several
      anaerobic/aerobic microbes were associated with an increased risk of PID,
      irrespective of duration of IUD use. Long-term IUD use appeared to be
      associated with an increased risk of a PID being complicated. CONCLUSION:
      The finding of several anaerobic or aerobic microbes appears to be
      associated with PID in users of IUD.

TI  - [Molecular diagnosis of heritable unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias].
PG  - 8-13
AB  - There is considerable evidence suggesting that genetic damages to human
      uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) gene located on
      clhromosome 2q37 are responsible for hereditary unconjugated
      hyperbilirubinemias (HUHB). The Crigler-Najjar syndrome of types I and II
      is characterized by structural mutations on one of 5 exons of HUHB gene,
      resulting in the synthesis of defective catalytically inactive isoforms of
      the enzyme. In Gilbert's syndrome, genetic alterations are located at the
      promoter of the gene and accompanied by the nucleotide insert of thymine
      adenine (TA). Promoter prolongation impairs the binding of IID
      transcription factor and leads to the decreased production of the enzyme
      UDPGT 1,1. Examination of the molecular epidemiology of gene mutations of
      UDPGT 1,1 that is typical of Gilbert's syndrome ascertained a great
      difference in the indices, from 2 to 16% in the Asian and European
      populations, respectively. In addition to polymerase chain reaction, high
      performance liquid chromatography may be used for the diagnosis of genetic
      alterations in Gilbert's syndrome.

TI  - The hormonal control of uterine luminal fluid secretion and absorption.
PG  - 17-28
AB  - The secretion of uterine luminal fluid initially provides a transport and
      support medium for spermatozoa and unimplanted embryos, while the
      absorption of uterine luminal fluid in early pregnancy results in the
      closure of the lumen and allows blastocysts to establish intimate contact
      with the uterine epithelium. We have established an in vivo perfusion
      technique of the lumen to study the hormonal control of the events in the
      peri-implantation period. Fluorescein-labelled dextran was included in the
      perfusion medium to monitor fluid movements and the concentrations of
      Na(+) and CI(-) ions in the effluent were monitored. Using an established
      regimen of steroid treatment of ovariectomized rats mimicking early
      pregnancy, oestradiol caused fluid secretion, while progesterone resulted
      in an amiloride-sensitive fluid absorption. Fluid absorption peaked at
      about the expected time of implantation. The effect of progesterone could
      be inhibited by treatment with a high dose of oestradiol, by the
      anti-progestin RU486, and by the presence of an intra-uterine
      contraceptive device. Studies of expression of Na(+) and CI(-) channels
      (ENaC, CFTR) indicated that these channels were subject to tissue-specific
      regulation within the uterus, but more work is required to determine their
      role and the factors controlling their abundance and localization in early
      pregnancy.

TI  - Gene expression in skeletal muscle of coronary artery disease patients
      after concentric and eccentric endurance training.
PG  - 413-22
AB  - Low-intensity concentric (CET) and eccentric (EET) endurance-type training
      induce specific structural adaptations in skeletal muscle. We evaluated to
      which extent steady-state adaptations in transcript levels are involved in
      the compensatory alterations of muscle mitochondria and myofibrils with
      CET versus EET at a matched metabolic exercise intensity of medicated,
      stable coronary patients (CAD). Biopsies were obtained from vastus
      lateralis muscle before and after 8 weeks of CET (n=6) or EET (n=6).
      Transcript levels for factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis
      (PGC-1alpha, Tfam), mitochondrial function (COX-1, COX-4), control of
      contractile phenotype (MyHC I, IIa, IIx) as well as mechanical stress
      marker (IGF-I) were quantified using an reverse-transcriptase polymerase
      chain reaction approach. After 8 weeks of EET, a reduction of the COX-4
      mRNA level by 41% and a tendency for a drop in Tfam transcript
      concentration (-33%, P=0.06) was noted. This down-regulation corresponded
      to a drop in total mitochondrial volume density. MyHC-IIa transcript
      levels were specifically decreased after EET, and MyHC-I mRNA showed a
      trend towards a reduction (P=0.08). Total fiber cross-sectional area was
      not altered. After CET and EET, the IGF-I mRNA level was significantly
      increased. The PGC-1alpha significantly correlated with Tfam, and both
      PGC-1alpha and Tfam significantly correlated with COX-1 and COX-4 mRNAs.
      Post-hoc analysis identified significant interactions between the
      concurrent medication and muscular transcript levels as well as fiber
      size. Our findings support the concept that specific transcriptional
      adaptations mediate the divergent mitochondrial response of muscle cells
      to endurance training under different load condition and indicate a
      mismatch of processes related to muscle hypertrophy in medicated CAD
      patients.

TI  - Screening and preventive behaviors one year after predictive genetic
      testing for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma.
PG  - 273-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention benefits from predictive genetic testing for cancer
      will only be fully realized if appropriate screening is adopted after
      testing. The current study assessed screening and preventive behaviors
      during 12 months after predictive genetic testing for hereditary
      nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) in an Australian clinical
      cohort. METHODS: Participants received predictive genetic testing for
      HNPCC at one of five Australian familial cancer clinics. Data on
      self-reported screening behaviors (colonoscopy, and endometrial sampling
      and transvaginal ultrasound for women) and prophylactic surgery
      (colectomy, and hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy for women) were
      collected using postal questionnaires before (baseline) and 12 months
      after receipt of genetic test results. Age, gender, perceived risk of
      cancer, and cancer-specific distress were assessed as predictors of
      colonoscopic screening. RESULTS: In the current study, 114 participants
      returned baseline questionnaires (32 carriers and 82 noncarriers of an
      HNPCC mutation). Ninety-eight participants also returned a 12-month
      follow-up questionnaire. Of those > or = 25 years, 73% reported having had
      a colonoscopy before genetic testing. At follow-up, 71% (15 of 25) of
      carriers and 12% (8 of 65) of noncarriers reported having a colonoscopy in
      the 12 months after receipt of test results. The reduction in colonoscopy
      among noncarriers was statistically significant (P < 0.001). High
      perceived risk was associated with colonoscopy at baseline. At follow-up,
      mutation status was the only variable significantly associated with
      colonoscopy. Among female mutation carriers, 47% reported having
      transvaginal ultrasonography and 53% endometrial sampling during
      follow-up. There was low uptake of prophylactic surgery for colorectal,
      endometrial, or ovarian carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of
      individuals reported appropriate screening behaviors after predictive
      genetic testing for HNPCC. The small group of noncarriers who had
      screening after genetic testing might benefit from additional counseling.

TI  - Peyronie's disease: a silent consequence of diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - AIM: To investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with
      Peyronie's disease (PD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: During an
      8-year period, a total of 307 men seen at our outpatient clinic were
      diagnosed with PD. Clinical characteristics, penile deformities and the
      erectile status of patients with PD and DM together (n=102) were
      retrospectively analyzed and compared to patients with PD alone with no
      risk factors for systemic vascular diseases (n=97). RESULTS: The
      prevalence of PD among men with DM and sexual dysfunction was 10.7%. The
      mean age of diabetic patients with PD was (55.9+/-8.9) years; in the no
      risk factor group it was (48.5+/-9.0) years (P < 0.05). The median
      duration of DM was 5 years. The majority of diabetic patients with PD
      (56.0%) presented in the chronic phase (P < 0.05), and they were more
      likely to have a severe penile deformity (>60 degrees) than the no risk
      factor group (P < 0.05). In the diabetic group, the most common presenting
      symptom was penile curvature (81.4%), followed by a palpable nodule on the
      shaft of the penis (22.5%) and penile pain with erection (14.7%). A total
      of 19.6% of patients were not aware of their penile deformities in the
      diabetic group. Erectile function, provided by history and in response to
      intracavernosal injection and a stimulation test, was significantly
      diminished in patients with PD and DM (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: DM probably
      exaggerates the fibrotic process in PD. Diabetic patients with PD have a
      higher risk of severe deformity and erectile dysfunction (ED). PD seems to
      be a silent consequence of DM and should be actively sought in diabetic
      men.

PG  - 161-8
AB  - We present the case of a 1 day-old newborn with extensive squamous cell
      peritonitis resulting from vaginal atresia with hydrometrocolpos and
      squamous cell reflux through the genital system, a combination rarely
      recognized in the literature. Delivery was preceded by ultrasound
      diagnosis of oligohydramnios and "large bladder," the latter representing
      the dilated proximal vagina. Additional findings included paraesophageal
      hiatus hernia containing squames, urethral atresia, absence of vulva, lung
      hypoplasia, mild hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and short umbilical
      cord with single umbilical artery (SUA). The possible relationship of the
      SUA with the constellation of infradiaphragmatic malformations is
      discussed.

TI  - Influence of different treatment approaches on non-submerged and submerged
      healing of ligature induced peri-implantitis lesions: an experimental
      study in dogs.
PG  - 584-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: [corrected] The aim of the present study was to evaluate
      non-submerged and submerged healing of ligature induced peri-implantitis
      in dogs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peri-implantitis was induced by ligature
      placement in five beagle dogs (n = 30 implants). The defects were randomly
      and equally allocated in a split-mouth design to either closed treatment +
      non-submerged healing (CNS), or open treatment + submerged healing (OS)
      using an Er:YAG laser (ERL), an ultrasonic device (VUS), or plastic
      curettes + local application of metronidazole gel (PCM), respectively. The
      animals were sacrificed after 3 months. Clinical, radiological and
      histological (e.g. new bone-to-implant contact (BIC)) parameters were
      assessed. RESULTS: All treatment procedures resulted in statistically
      significant improvements of all clinical parameters at both CNS and OS
      implants. Radiological improvements were merely observed at OS implants.
      Histomorphometrical analysis revealed that all CNS implants exhibited
      comparable low amounts of new BIC (1.0-1.2%), while mean BIC was
      statistically significant higher in the respective OS groups [ERL (44.8%),
      PCM (14.8%), VUS (8.7%)]. CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the present
      study, it was concluded that (i) OS improved the outcome of treatment in
      comparison with CNS and (ii) ERL seemed to be more suitable to promote
      re-osseointegration than PCM and VUS.

TI  - Calcitonin gene-related peptide inhibits interleukin-1beta-induced
      endogenous monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 secretion in type II
      alveolar epithelial cells.
PG  - C456-65
AB  - As important multifunctional cells in the lung, alveolar epithelial type
      II (AEII) cells secrete numerous chemokines on various stimuli. Our
      previous data showed that AEII cells also express the neuropeptide
      calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the proinflammatory factor
      interleukin (IL)-1beta induces CGRP secretion in the A549 human AEII cell
      line. In the present study, the CGRP-1 receptor antagonist human
      (h)CGRP(8-37) (0.1-1 nM) greatly amplified the production of
      IL-1beta-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. The inhibition
      of CGRP expression by small interfering RNA significantly increased MCP-1
      secretion on IL-1beta stimulation. However, exogenous hCGRP (10-100 nM)
      suppressed IL-1beta-evoked MCP-1 secretion in MCP-1 promoter activity, and
      CGRP gene stably transfected cell clones significantly inhibited both the
      mRNA and protein levels of MCP-1 induced by IL-1beta. These data imply
      that AEII-derived CGRP suppressed IL-1beta-induced MCP-1 secretion in an
      autocrine/paracrine mode. Subsequent investigation revealed that CGRP
      inhibited IL-1beta-evoked NF-kappaB activity by suppressing IkappaBalpha
      phosphorylation and degradation. Moreover, CGRP attenuated
      IL-1beta-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, the early event
      in proinflammatory factor signaling. We previously showed that the CGRP
      inhibitory effect was mediated by elevated intracellular cAMP and show
      here that analogs of cAMP, 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic
      monophosphothioate and the Sp isomer of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic
      monophosphothioate, mimicked the CGRP suppressive effect on
      IL-1beta-induced ROS formation, NF-kappaB activation, and MCP-1 secretion.
      Thus increased endogenous CGRP secretion in lung inflammatory disease
      might eliminate the excessive response by elevating the cAMP level through
      inhibiting the ROS-NF-kappaB-MCP-1 pathway.

TI  - N-3 PUFAs reduce oxidative stress in ESRD patients on maintenance HD by

PG  - 1450-4
AB  - Reactive oxygen species formation and release of
      pro-inflammatory/pro-atherogenic cytokines, that is, interleukin 1-beta
      and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, need the activation of the arachidonic
      acid cascade via the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox). 5-Lox activity and
      expression are significantly increased in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMCs) of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on maintenance
      hemodialysis (HD). Diets enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFAs) (omega-3) have been associated to a lower incidence of coronary
      heart disease (CHD) and a reduction in atherosclerotic lesions. Omega-3
      may interfere with the arachidonic acid cascade by inhibiting 5-Lox. Lipid
      peroxidation, leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) production, 5-Lox activity and
      expression were investigated in PBMC isolated from ESRD patients under
      maintenance HD before and after a 3-month oral supplementation with
      omega-3 at a daily dose of 2700 mg of n-3 PUFAs at the average
      eicosapentaenoic acid/docosaesaenoic acid ratio of 1.2 and finally after a
      further 3-month washout with no omega-3 supplementation. PBMCs from
      non-uremic volunteers were also investigated for comparison to normal
      parameters. Administration of omega-3 reduced significantly lipid
      peroxidation (P < 0.0001), LTB(4) synthesis (P < 0.0001) and 5-Lox
      activity (P < 0.0001), with no effect on 5-Lox protein expression. After
      the 3-month washout, all parameters were comparable to those observed
      before treatment. Our results resemble those obtained after oral
      administration of vitamin E and are consistent with a reversible,
      dose-dependent inhibition of 5-Lox by omega-3. Upregulation of 5-Lox may
      also be related to the increased mitochondrial damage and apoptosis of
      PBMCs observed in ESRD patients compared to non-uremic controls. Omega-3
      may thus protect PBMCs of ESRD patients against oxidative stress.

TI  - Non-operative breast pathology: lobular neoplasia.
PG  - 1321-7
AB  - Lobular neoplasia is a relatively uncommon lesion, which is frequently
      diagnosed in biopsy specimens taken for other reasons. Although the
      histological features of this lesion are well known, its biological
      significance as a "risk indicator" or "breast cancer precursor" has been a
      matter of debate. This review provides an update on recent
      clinicopathological and molecular data on lobular neoplasia and how these
      have changed the way these lesions are perceived and, most importantly,
      managed. Furthermore, the current recommendations for the management of
      lobular neoplasia diagnosed on core needle biopsies proposed in the
      National Health Service Breast Cancer Screening guidelines are discussed.

TI  - Features of the clear zone of odontoclasts in the Chinook salmon
      (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).
PG  - 87-93
AB  - This study aims to clarify the features of the clear zone of odontoclasts
      on shedding teeth of a teleost fish, Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus
      tshawytscha (Walbaum), using a light microscope to determine the
      orientation between a cell body and a resorptive lacuna, followed by
      transmission electron microscopy. Ultrathin sections of LR White embedded
      material were incubated in rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibody and then
      were incubated with 15 nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The clear
      zones of odontoclasts showed a variable structure with electron-dense
      structures on sections, but distinct clear zones were not always seen on
      odontoclasts. In odontoclasts sectioned in the direction perpendicularly
      to the surface of a resorptive lacuna, some cells showed a wide clear
      zone, but two types of clear zones were usually observed: a part composed
      of some cytoplasmic processes and one composed of several complicatedly
      interwoven processes. Gold particles were localized on the clear zones,
      especially in electron-dense structures; very few gold particles were
      detected in ruffled borders. These results show that the clear zone of
      odontoclasts in Chinook salmon contains actin. Our results suggest that
      the clear zone of an odontoclast in Chinook salmon is not always a wide
      annular structure.

TI  - Differential binding of erythroid Krupple-like factor to embryonic/fetal
      globin gene promoters during development.
PG  - 16052-7
AB  - The competition model for beta-like globin gene switching during
      development predicts that differential binding of transcription factors to
      globin gene promoters and/or proximal enhancers regulate the competitive
      interactions of globin gene family members with the powerful locus control
      region (LCR). Direct interactions of individual genes with the LCR are
      essential for high level expression in erythroid cells. In this paper, we
      have demonstrated, by chromatin immunoprecipitation, that
      erythroid-Krupple-like factor (EKLF) binds to embryonic/fetal globin gene
      promoters in primitive (but not in definitive) erythroid cells. EKLF binds
      strongly to adult globin gene promoters and to LCR sequences HS4, HS3,
      HS2, and HS1 in both primitive and definitive erythroid cells.
      Trimethylation of histone H3K4 and H3K27 at the embryonic/fetal and adult
      globin gene promoters is equivalent in definitive cells; therefore, the
      differential binding of EKLF to these promoters does not appear to result
      from changes in chromatin configuration. Interestingly, the level of EKLF
      in definitive cells is 3-fold higher than the level in primitive cells.
      These results suggest that temporal-specific changes in EKLF abundance
      result in differential binding of this essential erythroid transcription
      factor to embryonic/fetal globin gene promoters during development and
      that these changes in EKLF binding specificity mediate the competitive
      interactions of globin gene family members with the LCR.

      descent living in the U.S.?
PG  - 203-17
AB  - Given that researchers have found increased risk for suicidality and other
      psychiatric problems among acculturated individuals, we predicted similar
      results for African-descended people living in the U.S. We surveyed a
      community sample of 423 adult men and women of African descent to
      determine acculturation's relationship to Black suicide. Participants
      completed the African American Acculturation Scale, the Multi-Dimensional
      Support Scale, and a subscale of the Spiritual Well-Being Scale. Suicidal
      ideation and history of suicide attempt were defined as a "yes" response
      to the questions, "have you ever considered taking your own life?" and
      "have you ever attempted to take your own life?" We found that religious
      well-being (not acculturation) was predictive of both suicidal ideation
      and history of suicide attempt.

TI  - Nerve injury affects the capillary supply in rat slow and fast muscles
      differently.
PG  - 305-12
AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the acute effects of permanent
      denervation on the length density of the capillary network in rat slow
      soleus (SOL) and fast extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles and the
      effect of short-lasting reinnervation in slow muscle only. Denervation was
      performed by cutting the sciatic nerve. Both muscles were excised 2 weeks
      later. Reinnervation was studied 4 weeks after nerve crush in SOL muscle
      only. Capillaries and muscle fibres were visualised by triple
      immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against CD31 and laminin and
      with fluorescein-labelled Griffonia (Bandeira) simplicifolia lectin. A
      recently developed stereological approach allowing the estimation of the
      length of capillaries adjacent to each individual fibre (Lcap/Lfib) was
      employed. Three-dimensional virtual test grids were applied to stacks of
      optical images captured with a confocal microscope and their intersections
      with capillaries and muscle fibres were counted. Interrelationships among
      capillaries and muscle fibres were demonstrated with maximum intensity
      projection of the acquired stacks of optical images. The course of
      capillaries in EDL seemed to be parallel to the fibre axes, whereas in
      SOL, their preferential direction deviated from the fibre axes and formed
      more cross-connections among neighbouring capillaries. Lcap/Lfib was
      clearly reduced in denervated SOL but remained unchanged in EDL, although
      the muscle fibres significantly atrophied in both muscle types. When
      soleus muscle was reinnervated, capillary length per unit fibre length was
      completely restored. The physiological background for the different
      responses of the capillary network in slow and fast muscle is discussed.

TI  - tBid interaction with cardiolipin primarily orchestrates mitochondrial
      dysfunctions and subsequently activates Bax and Bak.
PG  - 614-26
AB  - TNFR1/Fas engagement results in the cleavage of cytosolic Bid to truncated
      Bid (tBid), which translocates to mitochondria. We demonstrate that
      recombinant tBid induces in vitro immediate destabilization of the
      mitochondrial bioenergetic homeostasis. These alterations result in mild
      uncoupling of mitochondrial state-4 respiration, associated with an
      inhibition the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated respiration and
      phosphorylation rate. tBid disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis was
      inhibited in mitochondria overexpressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. The inhibition
      of state-3 respiration is mediated by the reorganization of cardiolipin
      within the mitochondrial membranes, which indirectly affects the activity
      of the ADP/ATP translocator. Cardiolipin-deficient yeast mitochondria did
      not exhibit any respiratory inhibition by tBid, proving the absolute
      requirement for cardiolipin for tBid binding and activity. In contrast,
      the wild-type yeast mitochondria underwent a similar inhibition of
      ADP-stimulated respiration associated with reduced ATP synthesis. These
      events suggest that mitochondrial lipids rather than proteins are the key
      determinants of tBid-induced destabilization of mitochondrial
      bioenergetics.

TI  - Novel mechanism of inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B DNA-binding
      activity by diterpenoids isolated from Isodon rubescens.
PG  - 286-97
AB  - The development of specific inhibitors that can block nuclear
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation is an approach for the treatment of
      cancer, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases. Several diterpenoids,
      oridonin, ponicidin, xindongnin A, and xindongnin B were isolated from the
      herb Isodon rubescens. These compounds were found to be potent inhibitors
      of NF-kappaB transcription activity and the expression of its downstream
      targets, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase. The
      mechanisms of action of the diterpenoids against NF-kappaB are similar,
      but significant differences were also identified. All of the diterpenoids
      directly interfere with the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB to its
      response DNA sequence. Oridonin and ponicidin have an additional impact on
      the translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytoplasm to nuclei without
      affecting IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and degradation. The effect of
      these compounds on the interaction of NF-kappaB with consensus DNA
      sequences is unique. Different inhibitory effects were observed when
      NF-kappaB bound to various DNA sequences. Both p65/p65 and p50/p50
      homodimers, as well as p65/p50 heterodimer association with their
      responsive DNA, were inhibited. Kinetic studies on NF-kappaB-DNA
      interaction indicate that the diterpenoids decrease the B(max app) but
      have no effect on K(d app). This suggests that this class of compounds
      interacts with both p65 and p50 subunits at a site other than the DNA
      binding site and subsequently modulates the binding affinity of the
      transcription factor toward DNA with different NF-kappaB binding
      sequences. The diterpenoid structure could therefore serve as a scaffold
      for the development of more potent and selective NF-kappaB inhibitors that
      target regulated gene transcription.

TI  - Diagnostic developments involving cell-free (circulating) nucleic acids.
PG  - 187-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: The detection of circulating nucleic acids has long been
      explored for the non-invasive diagnosis of a variety of clinical
      conditions. In earlier studies, detection of circulating DNA has been
      investigated for the detection of various forms of cancer. Metastasis and
      recurrence in certain cancer types have been associated with the presence
      of high levels of tumor-derived DNA in the circulation. In the case of
      pregnancies, detection of fetal DNA in maternal plasma is a useful tool
      for detecting and monitoring certain fetal diseases and
      pregnancy-associated complications. Similarly, levels of circulating DNA
      have been reported to be elevated in acute medical emergencies, including
      trauma and stroke, and have been explored as indicators of clinical
      severity. Apart from circulating DNA, much attention and effort have been
      put into the study of circulating RNA over the last few years. This area
      started from the detection of tumor-derived RNA in the plasma of cancer
      patients. Soon after that, detection of circulating fetal RNA in maternal
      plasma was described. Plasma RNA detection appears to be a promising
      approach for the development of gender- and polymorphism-independent fetal
      markers for prenatal diagnosis and monitoring. This development also opens
      up the possibility of non-invasive prenatal gene expression profiling by
      maternal blood analysis. Besides circulating DNA and RNA in plasma and
      serum, cell-free DNA in other body fluids, such as urine, has been
      detected in patients with different clinical conditions. Regardless of the
      sources of cell-free DNA for clinical use, the amount is frequently
      scarce. METHODS: Technical advancements in detecting free DNA have been
      made over the years. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that further developments
      in the field of circulating nucleic acids will provide us with new
      diagnostic and monitoring possibilities over the next few years.

TI  - High grade primary breast lymphoma: is it a different clinical entity?
PG  - 191-8
AB  - Primary lymphoma of the breast (PBL) is a rare neoplasm, its outcome
      remains unclear compared to other lymphomas. We performed a retrospective
      study of 19 cases of high grade PBL. There were 17 Diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL) and 2 follicular and diffuse grade 3 lymphomas. Four
      patients were treated with local treatment only, 15 received chemotherapy
      including 11 treated with CHOP or ACVBP regimens followed by involved
      field radiotherapy. The actuarial survival for the whole population was
      38%. Three of the 4 patients treated only with a local treatment died of
      their lymphoma. Three patients progressed on therapy and 5 relapsed in the
      first year of follow-up including 2 central nervous system recurrences.
      Among the 11 patients treated with chemotherapy, 2 died of their lymphoma.
      The overall survival of this subgroup was 73% (median follow-up of 57
      months). We observed, like others in the literature, a better prognosis
      for lymphomas co-expressing Bcl6 and CD 10. The treatment should be based
      on the same modalities, but including a CNS prophylaxis even if poor
      prognosis factors are lacking. A radical mastectomy increases the risk of
      treatment failure and has to be avoided.

TI  - Cadmium and lead contamination in japonica rice grains and its variation
      among the different locations in southeast China.
PG  - 156-66
AB  - On the basis of a large-scale survey with 269 sampling sites and a field
      experiment with 12 cultivars grown at 3 ecologically different locations,
      Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) contamination in milled rice grains and its
      variation among different locations were investigated in the area of
      southeast China. The objective of this study was mainly to assess the
      present situation of Cd and Pb contamination in rice grains harvested
      locally and find out the variation of Cd and Pb background levels in rice
      grains among the diverse regional locations. The results showed that: a)
      Cd concentrations in milled rice grains ranged from trace (below 10 ng/g)
      to 340 ng/g, with the means of 81.4 ng/g (AM) and 55.2 ng/g (GM) for the
      269 samples, whereas Pb concentrations ranged from trace (below 10 ng/g)
      to 1136 ng/g, with the means of 113.5 ng/g (AM) and 51.0 ng/g (GM),
      respectively. High frequency was observed for both the Cd and Pb
      concentrations ranging from trace to 200 ng/g, with 95.9% for Cd and 84.8%
      for Pb, respectively. b) ANOVA for the AMs and GMs among 269 sampling
      sites indicated that there were significant differences among the
      different spatial locations in Cd or Pb concentrations. c) The Cd
      concentrations in milled rice grains were poorly correlated with Pb
      concentration among the 269 sampling sites surveyed, and no significant
      difference (P>0.05) in the AMs or GMs of Cd and Pb concentration was
      observed among different cities within a range of the same provinces, only
      with an exception for 1-2 provinces. d) Variance analysis of Cd, Pb
      concentrations for 12 rice cultivars grown in three locations showed that
      the great difference in coefficients of variation (CV) was observed both
      among cultivars grown in the same location and among locations of
      cultivars planted, in which locations showed much more contribution to the
      variation of Cd or Pb concentration in milled rice grains as compared with
      cultivars.

TI  - Mutagenesis of Glycine 179 modulates both catalytic efficiency and reduced
      pyridine nucleotide specificity in cytochrome b5 reductase.
PG  - 13467-76
AB  - Cytochrome b5 reductase (cb5r), a member of the ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase
      family of flavoprotein transhydrogenases, catalyzes the NADH-dependent
      reduction of cytochrome b5. Within this family, a conserved "GxGxxP"
      sequence motif has been implicated in binding reduced pyridine
      nucleotides. However, Glycine 179, a conserved residue in cb5r primary
      structures, precedes this six-residue "180GxGxxP185" motif that has been
      identified as binding the adenosine moiety of NADH. To investigate the
      role of G179 in NADH complex formation and NAD(P)H specificity, a series
      of rat cb5r variants were generated, corresponding to G179A, G179P, G179T,
      and G179V, recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to
      homogeneity. Each mutant protein was found to incorporate FAD in a 1:1
      cofactor/protein stoichiometry and exhibited absorption and CD spectra
      that were identical to those of wild-type cb5r, indicating both correct
      protein folding and similar flavin environments, while oxidation-reduction
      potentials for the FAD/FADH2 couple (n = 2) were also comparable to the
      wild-type protein (E(o)' = -272 mV). All four mutants showed decreased
      NADH:ferricyanide reductase activities, with kcat decreasing in the order
      WT > G179A > G179P > G179T > G179V, with the G179V variant retaining only
      1.5% of the wild-type activity. The affinity for NADH also decreased in
      the order WT > G179A > G179P > G179T > G179V, with the Km(NADH) for G179V
      180-fold greater than that of the wild type. Both Ks(H4NAD) and Ks(NAD+)
      values confirmed that the G179 mutants had both compromised NADH- and
      NAD+-binding affinities. Determination of the NADH/NADPH specificity
      constant for the various mutants indicated that G179 also participated in
      pyridine nucleotide selectivity, with the G179V variant preferring NADPH
      approximately 8000 times more than wild-type cb5r. These results
      demonstrated that, while G179 was not critical for either flavin
      incorporation or maintenance of the appropriate flavin environment in
      cb5r, G179 was required for both effective NADH/NADPH selectivity and to
      maintain the correct orientation and position of the conserved cysteine in
      the proline-rich "CGpppM" motif that is critical for optimum NADH binding
      and efficient hydride transfer.

TI  - En bloc exclusion of the pulmonary vein region in the pig using off pump,
      beating, intra-cardiac surgery: a pilot study of minimally invasive
      surgery for atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1417-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Off-pump, closed, beating heart, minimally-invasive surgery in
      patients with lone atrial fibrillation (AF) must be effective to become
      the preferred alternative to catheter ablation. Because of the inherent
      anatomical limitations of the epicardial access, we explored the
      feasibility of an intracardiac approach. METHODS: We report an acute study
      of en bloc, cryo-exclusion of the pulmonary vein region in 7 pigs. The
      left atrial appendage (LAA) was approached via a left thoracotomy.
      Electrodes were attached to the posterior wall of the left atrium (LPA)
      and right atrial appendage (RAA) for pacing and electrophysiological
      monitoring. A modified Surgifrost probe was introduced via the LAA and
      positioned using transesophageal (TEE) and intracardiac (ICE)
      echocardiographic guidance to generate encircling cryolesions (3 minutes,
      -105 degrees C) of the pulmonary vein region. RESULTS: A complete two-way
      block was achieved in 6 pigs and an incomplete block in 1. The excluded
      segment had very slow idiosyncratic rhythm or was electrically silent. In
      all pigs before isolation, sustained AF was inducible with the most rapid
      rhythms and fractionated electrograms recorded from the LA. While
      sustained AF was induced before exclusion, it was not after isolation in
      either the exclude or non-excluded segments. All tissue samples taken
      along the encircling cryolesions had transmural cryolesions on
      pathological examination. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that off-pump, closed
      heart, beating, intracardiac AF surgery is feasible, reliable and can
      duplicate the accuracy and precision of the open-heart approach. However,
      further developments are needed to make this novel approach an alternative
      to current approaches for catheter ablation.

TI  - Phase II study of recombinant human endostatin in patients with advanced
      neuroendocrine tumors.
PG  - 3555-61
AB  - PURPOSE: Endostatin is a 20-kd proteolytic fragment of collagen XVIII
      that, in preclinical studies, has been shown to have antiangiogenic and
      antitumor activity. Both preclinical and human phase I studies of
      recombinant human endostatin (rhEndostatin) suggested activity in
      neuroendocrine tumors, which are known to be hypervascular. We therefore
      performed a multicenter phase II study of rhEndostatin in patients with
      carcinoid or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Forty-two patients with advanced pancreatic endocrine tumors or carcinoid
      tumors were treated with rhEndostatin administered as a bid subcutaneous
      injection at a starting dose of 60 mg/m2/d. Steady-state trough levels
      were obtained after 6 weeks of therapy; patients who did not achieve a
      target therapeutic level of 300 ng/mL underwent dose escalation to 90
      mg/m2/d. Patients were observed for evidence of toxicity, response, and
      survival. RESULTS: rhEndostatin was associated with minimal toxicity.
      However, among 40 patients assessable for radiologic response, none
      experienced partial response to therapy, as defined by WHO criteria. The
      median steady-state trough level achieved after dose escalation was 331
      ng/mL, within the postulated therapeutic range. CONCLUSION: Treatment with
      rhEndostatin did not result in significant tumor regression in patients
      with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

TI  - Computerized prescribing alerts and group academic detailing to reduce the
      use of potentially inappropriate medications in older people.
PG  - 963-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of replacing drug-specific computerized
      prescribing alerts with age-specific alerts on rates of dispensing
      potentially inappropriate medications in older people and to determine
      whether group academic detailing enhances the effectiveness of these
      alerts. DESIGN: Cluster-randomized trial of group academic detailing and
      interrupted time-series analysis. SETTING: Fifteen clinics of a
      staff-model health maintenance organization. PARTICIPANTS: Seven practices
      (113 clinicians, 24,119 patients) were randomly assigned to receive
      age-specific prescribing alerts plus the academic detailing intervention;
      eight practices (126 clinicians, 26,805 patients) received alerts alone.
      Prior implementation of drug-specific alerts established a downward trend
      in use of target medications that served as the baseline trend for the
      present study. INTERVENTION: The computerized age-specific alerts occurred
      at the time of prescribing a targeted potentially inappropriate medication
      (e.g., tertiary tricyclic amine antidepressants, long-acting
      benzodiazepines, propoxyphene) and suggested an alternative medication.
      Clinicians at seven sites were randomized to group academic detailing, an
      interactive educational program delivering evidence-based information.
      MEASUREMENTS: Number of target medications dispensed per 10,000 patients
      per quarter, 2 years before and 1.5 years after the replacement of
      drug-specific with age-specific alerts. RESULTS: Age-specific alerts
      resulted in a continuation of the effects of the drug-specific alerts
      without measurable additional effect (P=.75 for level change), but the
      age-specific alerts led to fewer false-positive alerts for clinicians.
      Group academic detailing did not enhance the effect of the alerts.
      CONCLUSION: Age-specific alerts sustained the effectiveness of
      drug-specific alerts to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing in
      older people and resulted in a considerably decreased burden of the
      alerts.

      and tumor tissues of healthy and TVT-affected bitches and their relation
      to serum concentrations of estradiol-17beta and progesterone.
PG  - 1587-92
AB  - One of the most frequent canine neoplasms is the transmissible venereal
      tumor (TVT), which affects the male and the female genital tract. The
      objective of this study was to determine (immunohistochemically) estrogen
      receptor (ER-alpha) expression in vaginal tissue of healthy bitches and in
      the vaginal and neoplastic tissues of TVT-affected bitches. Fifty-eight
      bitches were divided into two groups: tumor group (TVT) and control group
      (healthy). Canine estrous cycle stages were determined by means of
      exfoliative vaginal cytology, hormone assays, and macroscopic appearance
      of ovaries. Samples from vaginal and neoplastic tissues were obtained
      under general anesthesia, fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde, embedded in
      paraffin, and sectioned. Anestrus, proestrus and estrus control females
      had higher ER-alpha expression than diestrus bitches. Within the tumor
      group, diestrus bitches had significantly higher ER-alpha expression.
      Although some samples had expression in the endothelium of blood vessels,
      no ER-alpha expression was observed in neoplastic tissues. In conclusion,
      vaginal tissue of tumor and control bitches, under different distinct
      steroid influences, had different ER-alpha expression, whereas ER-alpha
      expression was not present in neoplastic tissues.

TI  - Follicular arrest in polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with
      deficient inhibin A and B biosynthesis.
PG  - 5582-7
AB  - CONTEXT: Previous studies suggest that inhibin subunit expression is
      decreased in granulosa cells of women with polycystic ovary syndrome
      (PCOS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis
      that inhibin A and inhibin B protein concentrations are also decreased in
      PCOS follicles. DESIGN: The design was a parallel study. SETTING: The
      study was performed at an in vitro fertilization suite. PARTICIPANTS: We
      studied women with regular cycles (n = 36) and women with PCOS (n = 8).
      INTERVENTIONS: Follicular fluid was aspirated from the follicles of women
      with PCOS (n = 14 follicles) and from women with regular cycles at various
      times during the follicular phase (n = 50 follicles). MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE: Inhibin A and B concentrations from PCOS follicles were compared
      with those in size-matched follicles, dominant follicles (> or = 10 mm),
      and subordinate follicles from regularly cycling women. RESULTS: Inhibin A
      (220 +/- 38 vs. 400 +/- 72 IU/ml; P < 0.05) and inhibin B (75.4 +/- 10.4
      vs. 139 +/- 26 ng/ml; P < 0.05) concentrations were lower in the
      follicular fluid of PCOS follicles compared with those of size-matched
      follicles from regularly cycling women. Inhibin A was also lower in the
      follicular fluid of PCOS compared with subordinate follicles from normal
      women (577 +/- 166 IU/ml; P < 0.05). Inhibin A concentrations increased
      with increasing follicle size, resulting in significantly higher
      follicular fluid concentrations in dominant follicles from normal women
      compared with PCOS follicles (2298 +/- 228 IU/ml; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      These data demonstrate that inhibin A and inhibin B concentrations are
      significantly reduced in the follicular fluid of women with PCOS compared
      with those in the follicular fluid of size-matched follicles from normal
      women, consistent with the decreased inhibin subunit mRNA expression in
      previous studies. These findings point to the potential importance of
      inhibins in normal follicle development and suggest that inhibin
      deficiency may play a role in the follicle arrest associated with PCOS.

TI  - A role for retinal brain-derived neurotrophic factor in ocular dominance
      plasticity.
PG  - 2119-24
AB  - Visual deprivation is a classical tool to study the plasticity of visual
      cortical connections. After eyelid closure in young animals (monocular
      deprivation, MD), visual cortical neurons become dominated by the open
      eye, a phenomenon known as ocular dominance (OD) plasticity . It is
      commonly held that the molecular mediators of OD plasticity are cortically
      derived and that the retina is immune to the effects of MD . Recently, it
      has been reported that visual deprivation induces neurochemical,
      structural, and functional changes in the retina , but whether these
      retinal changes contribute to the effects of MD in the cortex is unknown.
      Here, we provide evidence that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
      produced in the retina influences OD plasticity. We found a reduction of
      BDNF expression in the deprived retina of young rats. We compensated this
      BDNF imbalance between the two eyes by either injecting exogenous BDNF in
      the deprived eye or reducing endogenous BDNF expression in the nondeprived
      eye. Both treatments were effective in counteracting the OD shift induced
      by MD. Retinal BDNF could also influence OD distribution in normal
      animals. These results show for the first time that OD plasticity is
      modulated by BDNF produced in the retina.

TI  - A combined analysis of North American case-control studies of residential
      radon and lung cancer.
PG  - 533-97
AB  - Cohort studies have consistently shown underground miners exposed to high
      levels of radon to be at excess risk of lung cancer, and extrapolations
      based on those results indicate that residential radon may be responsible
      for nearly 10-15% of all lung cancer deaths per year in the United States.
      However, case-control studies of residential radon and lung cancer have
      provided ambiguous evidence of radon lung cancer risks. Regardless,
      alpha-particle emissions from the short-lived radioactive radon decay
      products can damage cellular DNA. The possibility that a demonstrated lung
      carcinogen may be present in large numbers of homes raises a serious
      public health concern. Thus, a systematic analysis of pooled data from all
      North American residential radon studies was undertaken to provide a more
      direct characterization of the public health risk posed by prolonged radon
      exposure. To evaluate the risk associated with prolonged residential radon
      exposure, a combined analysis of the primary data from seven large scale
      case-control studies of residential radon and lung cancer risk was
      conducted. The combined data set included a total of 4081 cases and 5281
      controls, representing the largest aggregation of data on residential
      radon and lung cancer conducted to date. Residential radon concentrations
      were determined primarily by a-track detectors placed in the living areas
      of homes of the study subjects in order to obtain an integrated 1-yr
      average radon concentration in indoor air. Conditional likelihood
      regression was used to estimate the excess risk of lung cancer due to
      residential radon exposure, with adjustment for attained age, sex, study,
      smoking factors, residential mobility, and completeness of radon
      measurements. Although the main analyses were based on the combined data
      set as a whole, we also considered subsets of the data considered to have
      more accurate radon dosimetry. This included a subset of the data
      involving 3662 cases and 4966 controls with a-track radon measurements
      within the exposure time window (ETW) 5-30 yr prior to the index date
      considered previously by Krewski et al. (2005). Additional restrictions
      focused on subjects for which a greater proportion of the ETW was covered
      by measured rather than imputed radon concentrations, and on subjects who
      occupied at most two residences. The estimated odds ratio (OR) of lung
      cancer generally increased with radon concentration. The OR trend was
      consistent with linearity (p = .10), and the excess OR (EOR) was 0.10 per
      Bq/m3 with 95% confidence limits (-0.01, 0.26). For the subset of the data
      considered previously by Krewski et al. (2005), the EOR was 0.11 (0.00,
      0.28). Further limiting subjects based on our criteria (residential
      stability and completeness of radon monitoring) expected to improve radon
      dosimetry led to increased estimates of the EOR. For example, for subjects
      who had resided in only one or two houses in the 5-30 ETW and who had
      a-track radon measurements for at least 20 yr of this 25-yr period, the
      EOR was 0.18 (0.02, 0.43) per 100 Bq/m3. Both estimates are compatible
      with the EOR of 0.12 (0.02, 0.25) per 100 Bq/m3 predicted by downward
      extrapolation of the miner data. Collectively, these results provide
      direct evidence of an association between residential radon and lung
      cancer risk, a finding predicted by extrapolation of results from
      occupational studies of radon-exposed underground miners.

      cysticercosis patients in eastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China.
PG  - 625-30
AB  - Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is one of the major causes of neurological
      disease in China. ELISA and immunoblotting using glycoproteins purified by
      preparative isoelectric focusing were used to detect human cysticercosis
      in Tongliao area, Inner Mongolia, China in 1998. Approximately 89% (39 of
      44 inpatients and outpatients with suspected NCC at Tongliao City
      Hospital) were residents of Inner Mongolia. About 53% were male and 77%
      were of working age (18-59 years), and 32% were farmers. Immunoblotting
      and ELISA showed a high correlation. Of the 44 patients, 31 positive by
      cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan were confirmed serologically to
      have cysticercosis. In the ELISA, patients with no lesions by CT scan had
      lower OD values, similar to those of normal serum. These findings confirm
      that both ELISA and immunoblotting assays are sufficiently sensitive to
      detect asymptomatic or symptomatic cysticercosis patients.

      biopsies with conventional staining and immunocytochemistry.
PG  - 152-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the histomorphometric features of megakaryocytic
      elements in bone marrow trephine biopsies of various subtypes of
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). STUDY DESIGN: Comparative image
      morphometry using hematoxylin-eosin-stained and CD 61-stained trephine
      biopsies was carried out on 40 cases of MDS and 10 normal subjects to
      analyze the megakaryocytes objectively. The various variables analyzed
      were number of megakaryocytes and micromegakaryocytes, area, perimeter and
      diameter of the megakaryocytic elements. RESULTS: The mean number of
      megakaryocytes was lower in cases of MDS as compared to the normals in all
      except for a single case of hypoplastic MDS, in which the megakaryocytes
      were more abundant (3.6 per high-power field [hpf]). No
      micromegakaryocytes were observed in the 2 cases of chronic myelomonocytic
      leukemia. The mean area, perimeter and diameter of megakaryocytes
      decreased significantly on immunostaining with CD 61. CONCLUSION: The mean
      number of megakaryocytes per hpf was lower in the cases of MDS as compared
      to normal cases on hematoxylin-eosin. However, on CD 61 staining the
      number of megakaryocytes per hpf increased in cases of MDS.
      Micromegakaryocytes were seen in scanty numbers in the normals but
      increased in MDS cases and increased significantly on CD 61
      immunostaining. The mean area, perimeter and diameter of megakaryocytes
      decreased significantly on immunostaining with CD 61, indicating the
      increased numbers of micromegakaryocytes in MDS. Hence, immunostaining is
      an efficient method of detecting increased numbers of megakaryocytes and
      micromegakaryocytes that would ordinarily be missed by using routine
      hematoxylin-eosin staining.

TI  - Expression of BAFF-R (BR 3) in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues
      characterized with a newly developed monoclonal antibody.
PG  - 53-60
AB  - BAFF-receptor (BAFF-R) is required for the successful maturation and
      survival of B-cells. We developed an anti-human BAFF-R monoclonal antibody
      (mAb), 8 A 7. The reactivity of 8 A 7 in normal and neoplastic tissue was
      examined by performing immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections.
      8 A 7 reacted with lymphocytes in the mantle and marginal zones, but not
      with lymphocytes in the interfollicular area. Lymphocytes in the germinal
      centers were found to be negative or occasionally weakly positive for 8 A
      7. BAFF-R expression was found only in B-cell lymphoma (44/80, positive
      cases/examined cases): B-lymphoblastic lymphoma 0/3, B-chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma 4/4, mantle cell lymphoma 9/11,
      follicular lymphoma 10/14, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 11/25,
      marginal zone B-cell lymphoma 8/10, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 2/2, plasma
      cell myeloma 0/2, and Burkitt lymphoma 0/9, but not in T/NK cell lymphomas
      (0/19) or Hodgkin lymphoma (0/10). BAFF-R was expressed in most low-grade
      B-cell neoplasms and a small number of DLBCL, suggesting that BAFF-R may
      play an important role in the proliferation of neoplastic lymphoid cells.
      Thus, the mAb is very useful for further understanding of both healthy
      B-cell biology and its pathogenic neoplasms.

TI  - A soft-tissue approach to midfacial hypoplasia associated with Treacher
      Collins syndrome.
PG  - 522-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treacher Collins syndrome is an autosomal dominant
      mandibulofacial dysostosis with characteristic hard- and soft-tissue
      facial abnormalities. These include ocular malformations, ear
      malformations, and hypoplasia of the facial skeleton, especially of the
      malar bones and mandible. Traditionally, surgical correction of the facial
      abnormalities has focused on skeletal reconstruction to restore facial
      form and symmetry. In this report, we describe the use of customized
      parascapular free flaps, after standard reconstructive surgeries, for the
      correction of defects of facial contour in Treacher Collins patients. In
      most cases, bony reconstruction of the zygoma or periorbita is not
      required. METHODS: From June 1995 to December 2003, 8 patients with
      Treacher Collins syndrome underwent microsurgical correction of facial
      contour using 16 free flaps. In all patients, staged parascapular free
      flaps were used for reconstruction. The microvascular technique involved a
      2-team approach with simultaneous ipsilateral parascapular flap harvest
      and facial pocket dissection. The flaps were contoured, revascularized (14
      superficial temporal vessels, 2 facial vessels), and inset. No vein grafts
      were used. The patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year, and
      postoperative evaluation included medical photography, visual assessment,
      and evaluation by the patient and family. RESULTS: Seven patients had
      previous facial skeleton correction using craniofacial techniques. The age
      at operation ranged from 4-19 years. Sixteen parascapular free flaps were
      used in the 8 patients. Postoperative complications were limited to 1
      hematoma. There were no partial or total flap losses. All of the patients
      had improved facial contour and symmetry. Overlying skin tone and color
      similarly improved. CONCLUSION: After traditional skeletal reconstruction
      for the complex craniofacial defects of Treacher Collins syndrome,
      deficiencies in facial contour and symmetry usually persist. Customized
      soft-tissue free flaps can be employed to differentially resurface these
      defects and achieve optimal esthetic results in these challenging
      patients.

TI  - The regulation of veratridine-stimulated electrogenic ion transport in
      mouse colon by neuropeptide Y (NPY), Y1 and Y2 receptors.
PG  - 712-22
AB  - 1 Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a prominent enteric neuropeptide with prolonged
      antisecretory effects in mammalian intestine. Veratridine depolarises
      neurons consequently causing epithelial anion secretion across mouse colon
      mucosa. Our aim was to characterise functionally, veratridine-stimulated
      mucosal responses and to determine the roles for NPY, Y(1), and Y(2)
      receptors in modulating these neurogenic effects. 2 Colon mucosae (with
      intact submucous innervation) from wild-type mice (+/+) and knockouts
      lacking either NPY (NPY-/-), Y(1)-/- or Y(2)-/- were placed in Ussing
      chambers and voltage clamped at 0 mV. Veratridine-stimulated short-circuit
      current (I(sc)) responses in +/+, Y(1) or Y(2) antagonist pretreated +/+
      colon, Y(1)-/- and NPY-/- colon were insensitive to cholinergic blockade
      by atropine (At; 1 microM) and hexamethonium (Hex; 10 microM).
      Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 100 nM) abolished veratridine responses, but had no
      effect upon carbachol (CCh) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide
      (VIP)-induced secretory responses. 3 To establish the functional roles for
      Y(1) and Y(2) receptors, +/+ tissues were pretreated with either the Y(1)
      or Y(2) receptor antagonist (BIBO3304 (300 nM) or BIIE0246 (1 microM),
      respectively) and veratridine responses were compared with those from
      Y(1)-/- or Y(2)-/- colon. Neither BIBO3304 nor Y(1)-/- altered
      veratridine-induced secretion, but Y(1) agonist responses were abolished
      in both preparations. In contrast, the Y(2) antagonist BIIE0246
      significantly amplified veratridine responses in +/+ mucosa. Unexpectedly,
      NPY-/- colon exhibited significantly attenuated veratridine responses
      (between 1 and 5 min). 4 We demonstrate that electrogenic veratridine
      responses in mouse colon are noncholinergic and that NPY can act directly
      upon epithelia, a Y(1) receptor effect. The enhanced veratridine response
      observed in +/+ tissue following BIIE0246, indicates that Y(2) receptors
      are located on submucosal neurons and that their activation by NPY will
      inhibit enteric noncholinergic secretory neurotransmission. 5 We also
      demonstrate Y(1) and Y(2) receptor-mediated antisecretory tone in +/+
      colon and show selective loss of each in Y(1) and Y(2) null colon
      respectively. In NPY-/- tissue, only Y(1)-mediated tone was present, this
      presumably being mediated by endogenous endocrine peptide YY. Y(2) tone
      was absent from NPY-/- (and Y(2)-/-) colon and we conclude that NPY
      activation of neuronal Y(2) receptors attenuates secretory
      neurotransmission thereby providing an absorptive electrolyte tone in
      isolated colon.

      Down's syndrome. DESIGN: Participants with Down's syndrome (N=26) were
      compared with non-Down syndrome learning disabled participants (N=26).
      METHOD: The two group's performance on a range of tests of executive
      function were compared. Groups were matched on age and a measure of
      vocabulary. RESULTS: The Down's syndrome group performed at a
      significantly lower level on a number of tests of executive function.
      CONCLUSION: It is suggested that impaired executive function in Down's
      syndrome is due to abnormal development of the prefrontal cortex in Down's
      syndrome. Tests of executive function may be sensitive to cognitive
      changes with the onset of dementia in people with Down's syndrome.
      Longitudinal studies examining changes in executive function in people
      with Down's syndrome are recommended.

TI  - Dystonia in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - VII7-13
AB  - Dystonia can occasionally be found in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. It
      is very uncommon in untreated patients and is more frequently seen as a
      complication of its treatment. In this review, the various types of
      dystonia occurring in PD, the differential diagnosis with other
      parkinsonian syndromes associated with dystonia and treatments available
      are revised. Dystonia unrelated to treatment can be typical
      (blepharospasm, torticollis), atypical (parkinsonian writer's cramp,
      camptocormia, anismus), or occurring in earlyonset Parkinson disease (the
      so-called kinesigenic foot dystonia, considered a hallmark of early-onset
      Parkinson's disease). Early and prominent dystonia in untreated patients
      with parkinsonism should raise the suspicion of other entities other than
      Parkinson's disease, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple
      system atrophy or corticobasal degeneration. In patients on chronic
      dopaminergic treatment, peak-dose dystonia, diphasic dystonia and
      off-dystonia can be seen. The later constitutes the major dystonic feature
      of chronic levodopa therapy, and a wide variety of strategies are
      available to manage this complication. Among them, deep brain stimulation
      of the subthalamic nucleus has proved to be the most effective one.
      Dystonic reactions (mainly involving oculomotor cranial nerves and limbs)
      in operated patients (especially carriers of deep brain stimulation (DBS)
      devices) are increasingly being reported, constituting a new type of
      dystonia in patients with Parkinson's disease: dystonia linked to surgical
      treatment.

TI  - Results and complications with the mini-laparotomic incision in 52
      consecutive radical retropubic prostatectomies.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We describe a simple mono-institutional study to prospectively
      assess the benefits and complications of the mini-laparotomic incision for
      radical retropubic prostatectomy with the anatomic approach. METHODS:
      Radical retropubic prostatectomy with the anatomical approach, as
      described by Walsh, was performed through a 4 to 8 cm incision. Median
      operative time, body weight, prostate weight, pathologic stage, incidence
      of positive surgical margins, urinary continence, the need for
      post-operative analgesics, peri-operative complications, are the
      parameters we assessed. Blood losses were calculated with the aid of a
      specific formula instead of simply recording the suction or weighing the
      sponges. RESULTS: 52 patients were consecutively operated on through a
      mini-laparotomic incision. Median incisional length was 8 cm (range 4 to 8
      cm). Median operating time was 116 minutes (105-141), calculated blood
      loss was 1108.797ml, incidence of positive margins was 14%, urinary
      continence was observed in 48/50 patients (98%), and there was a
      complication rate of 4/52 (7.6%). CONCLUSION: The results we obtained with
      the mini-laparotomic incision are comparable to previous reports of the
      standard incision, also by our group, though with a lower need for
      postoperative analgesia. They also compare with laparoscopic prostatectomy
      in the length of time of catheterization and post-operative analgetic
      consumption.

PG  - 21-5
AB  - Deprotection of p-nitrobenzyl esters and valyl carbamates in carbapenem CL
      192,276 produced the active compound OCA-983 in excellent yields. Straight
      chain alkanols such as 1-butanol, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol in water at

      excellent yield and purity after removal of the aqueous media. This
      procedure is applicable to sensitive compounds that are soluble in water
      without the need to use a buffer and allows for ease of isolation from the
      aqueous phase.

TI  - Sickle cell disease in Uganda: a time for action.
PG  - 384-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To draw attention to the extent of homozygous sickle cell (SS)
      disease as a public health problem in Uganda where a mean 20% frequency of
      the sickle cell trait implies that 25,000 babies with SS disease are born
      each year. To highlight the dangers of applying interventions developed in
      non-malarial areas to regions where malaria may change the natural history
      and outcome of sickle cell disease. DATA SOURCES: The published literature
      from Africa and from the US and Caribbean in populations of African
      ancestry. STUDY SELECTION: The world literature especially, that derived
      from the US, Caribbean, and equatorial Africa. DATA EXTRACTION AND
      SYNTHESIS: In non-malarial areas, simple interventions applied early in
      life have significantly improved survival and the quality of life. Two
      well documented interventions are pneumococcal prophylaxis and the early
      parental diagnosis of acute splenic sequestration. The available
      literature from Africa suggests that neither of these may be appropriate
      in malarial areas. CONCLUSIONS: Manifestations of SS disease differ in
      malarial areas and it is questionable whether interventions developed in
      non-malarial areas apply. There is an urgent need to document the causes
      of death so that locally appropriate interventions may be developed to
      improve survival. Equally urgent is the need to define the pattern of
      clinical problems so that models of care may be evolved for use in
      malarial areas. Without this knowledge, health care planners will not have
      the information necessary to develop strategies and limited resources may
      be inappropriately deployed.

TI  - Executive dysfunction in major depressive disorder.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - Executive dysfunction is commonly seen in major depression. The types of
      executive deficits seen in depression include problems with planning,
      initiating and completing goal-directed activities. Executive dysfunction
      may vary as a function of the severity of depression. In addition, a
      subset of geriatric depression is also characterized by prominent deficits
      in executive functioning. The presence of executive dysfunction in
      depression is associated with vocational disability and possibly poorer
      treatment response. While few studies have examined the treatment of
      executive dysfunction in depression, preliminary work suggests that both
      pharmacologic interventions and psychosocial interventions such as problem
      solving therapy may be efficacious.

TI  - Microarray profiling of colorectal cancer in Bangladeshi patients.
PG  - 571-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We have carried out a retrospective analysis of all cases of
      colorectal cancer at the Royal London Hospital between April 1998 and
      March 2002 and determined the differences in presentation and outcome
      between Bangladeshi and Non-Bangladeshi patients. DNA microarrays were
      used to explain any potential genetic differences between these two groups
      that may explain the different phenotypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      examined the colorectal database at our institution. Microarray profiles,
      using Affymetrix HU133A Genechips (Santa Clara, CA USA) were obtained from
      10 Bangladeshi patients and an age-, sex- and stage-matched group of 10
      Non-Bangladeshi patients. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-three patients
      have been treated for colorectal cancer at the Royal London Hospital.
      Eighteen (5%) patients were of Bangladeshi origin. The prevalence was
      27/100,000 compared to 342/100,000 of the Non-Bangladeshi population.
      Eleven (61%) of 18 Bangladeshi patients were under the age of 40 and 4
      (22%) patients presented with locally advanced or metastatic disease. In
      comparison 39/345 (11%) of non-Bangladeshi patients presented with
      advanced disease. None of the Bangladeshi patients gave a positive family
      history. Microarray profiling between these two groups demonstrated 1203
      differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Colorectal cancer
      is uncommon in the Bangladeshi patients compared to the non-Bangladeshi
      population. This cancer presents in younger patients and at a more
      advanced stage. There is no positive family history within this ethnic
      community and therefore the cancers are sporadic. However, microarray
      profiling is able to delineate different gene expression between these two
      groups. Therefore, there should be a low threshold for investigating young
      Bangladeshi patients with symptoms of colorectal neoplasia and any future
      national screening programme should allow for ethnic variation.

TI  - Treatment of refractory pseudomonas aeruginosa exit-site infection by
      simultaneous removal and reinsertion of peritoneal dialysis catheter.
PG  - 560-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)
      with Pseudomonas aeruginosa exit-site infection (ESI) refractory to
      antibiotic treatment often require replacement of their peritoneal
      dialysis catheter (PDC). The optimal interval between removal and
      reinsertion of the PDC is not known. There are relatively few data on the
      feasibility of simultaneous removal and reinsertion of dialysis catheters
      for the treatment of P. aeruginosa ESI. METHODS: We retrospectively
      reviewed the short- and long-term outcomes of all CAPD patients who had
      undergone simultaneous removal and reinsertion of their PDC for the
      treatment of refractory P. aeruginosa ESI in our hospital between January
      1994 and December 2003. During the operation, the old catheter was removed
      first and a new catheter was inserted into the opposite side of the
      abdomen. All patients received 7 days of antibiotic therapy
      postoperatively. CAPD was resumed after 2 weeks of intermittent peritoneal
      dialysis. RESULTS: Over a 10-year period, 37 CAPD patients underwent the
      operation. Mean age of the patients was 59.5 +/- 10.9 years. The interval
      between the diagnosis of ESI and the operation was 16.7 +/- 6.9 weeks. The
      patients received 7.6 +/- 2.5 weeks of antibiotic treatment before the
      procedure. Early postoperative complications were uncommon. None of the
      patients developed ESI within 4 weeks after the operation. At 1 year after
      the operation, 3 patients (8%) had developed recurrence of P. aeruginosa
      ESI 24 - 40 weeks postoperatively. Peritonitis due to P. aeruginosa was
      not observed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that simultaneous removal and
      reinsertion of the PDC is feasible in eradicating refractory ESI due to P.
      aeruginosa. This procedure alleviates the need for temporary hemodialysis
      and allows continuation of peritoneal dialysis.

PG  - 341-4
AB  - The aim of this study was to provide guidelines for optimal
      anticoagulation in Chinese patients after mechanical heart valve
      replacement. A Carbomedics valve was implanted in 178 patients between
      July 2000 and July 2003. During follow-up, 22 bleeding events and 1
      thromboembolic complication occurred. The linearized rates of bleeding and
      thromboembolism were 5.83% and 0.26% per patient-year, respectively. The
      linearized mortality rate was 0.79% per patient-year. The final mean
      international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.68+/-0.38, however there was a
      significant variation between the early and late periods of follow-up. For
      Chinese patients with mechanical heart valves, bleeding was the major
      complication rather than thromboembolism. Low-dose anticoagulation
      (international normalized ratio 1.4-2.0) could markedly decrease bleeding
      and effectively prevent thromboembolism. As the INR was most unstable in
      the first postoperative month, re-examination of patients in this period
      is critical.

      histiocytosis.
PG  - 1143-5
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a case of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) that
      involved the anterior uveal tract. DESIGN: Interventional case report.
      METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on a patient with iris
      nodules and anterior uveitis in the setting of LCH. Visual acuity and
      clinical findings that were noted on slit lamp biomicroscopy were
      extracted. RESULTS: An 18-year-old male patient with unilateral anterior
      segment inflammation and iris nodules experienced visual improvement from
      20/200 to 20/25 after treatment with a 5-day course of topical
      corticosteroids. Regression of the iris nodules and anterior segment
      inflammation was also noted. Bone marrow aspirate confirmed recurrent,
      active LCH. CONCLUSION: The clinician should include LCH in the
      differential diagnosis when faced with anterior segment inflammation in
      conjunction with iris nodules. Additionally, LCH can be treated
      successfully with topical corticosteroid therapy.

TI  - Melatonin decreases neurovascular oxidative/nitrosative damage and
      protects against early increases in the blood-brain barrier permeability
      after transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice.
PG  - 175-82
AB  - We have recently shown that melatonin decreases the late (24 hr) increase
      in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and the risk of tissue
      plasminogen activator-induced hemorrhagic transformation following
      ischemic stroke in mice. In the study, we further explored whether
      melatonin would reduce postischemic neurovascular oxidative/nitrosative
      damage and, therefore, improve preservation of the early increase in the
      BBB permeability at 4 hr after transient focal cerebral ischemia for 60
      min in mice. Melatonin (5 mg/kg) or vehicle was given intraperitoneally at
      the beginning of reperfusion. Hydroethidine (HEt) in situ detection and
      immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine were used to evaluate postischemic
      accumulation in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, respectively, in the
      ischemic neurovascular unit. BBB permeability was evaluated by
      spectrophotometric and microscopic quantitation of Evans Blue leakage.
      Relative to controls, melatonin-treated animals not only had a
      significantly reduced superoxide accumulation in neurovascular units in
      boundary zones of infarction, by reducing 35% and 54% cytosolic oxidized
      HEt in intensity and cell-expressing percentage, respectively (P < 0.001),
      but also exhibited a reduction in nitrotyrosine by 52% (P < 0.01).
      Additionally, melatonin-treated animals had significantly reduced early
      postischemic disruption in the BBB permeability by 53% (P < 0.001). Thus,
      melatonin reduced postischemic oxidative/nitrosative damage to the
      ischemic neurovascular units and improved the preservation of BBB
      permeability at an early phase following transient focal cerebral ischemia
      in mice. The findings further highlight the ability of melatonin in
      anatomical and functional preservation for the ischemic neurovascular
      units and its relevant potential in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

TI  - Ophthalmic manifestations of Danon disease.
PG  - 1010-3
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the ophthalmic findings in patients with Danon
      disease, an X-linked condition causing cardiomyopathy in males and
      females. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with
      genetically proven Danon disease. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of
      complete eye examinations including electroretinogram, visual fields, and
      fluorescein angiography. RESULTS: Five females (4 affected) and 2 affected
      males were examined. The 4 affected females demonstrated a peripheral
      pigmentary retinopathy. Lens changes, myopia, abnormal electroretinogram
      and visual fields were also found. The males demonstrated a near-complete
      loss of pigment in the retinal pigment epithelium. CONCLUSION: We report
      the first description of a characteristic retinopathy in patients with
      Danon disease and the first extracardiac manifestations in affected
      females. Retinopathy potentially could be used to identify asymptomatic
      carriers.

      benzo[a]pyrene.
PG  - 1841-60
AB  - Chemopreventive effects of aloe against benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) mutagenicity
      were investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium bacterial mutation assay,
      the chromosome aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells,
      and the mouse micronuclei test using bone-marrow cells. In the bacterial
      assay, aloe produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the number of
      mutant colonies induced by BaP. The chromosome-damaging responses of BaP
      in CHO cells were abolished by treatment with aloe, approximately to the
      level seen in control. In the in vivo mouse bone-marrow micronuclei test,
      pretreatment of aloe 24 h prior to BaP treatment reduced the frequency of
      micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. In the cells of CHO and bone
      marrow treated with aloe, glutathione (GSH) levels were shown to be higher
      and extracellular discharge rate increased as incubation time with aloe
      rose. MDR1 and MRP2 gene were more expressed in Hepa c cells than in NTCC
      cells, but there was no change in BCRP gene expression. The antimutagenic
      effects of aloe were statistically significant and concentration
      dependent. These results demonstrated that aloe might exert
      chemopreventive effects against BaP-induced mutagenicity.

TI  - Relationship of stopped flow to steady state parameters in the dimeric
      copper amine oxidase from Hansenula polymorpha and the role of zinc in
      inhibiting activity at alternate copper-containing subunits.
PG  - 4683-94
AB  - The expression of a copper amine oxidase (CAO) from Hansenula polymorpha
      in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under differing culture conditions leads to
      the incorporation of varied levels of CAO-bound zinc. The presence of
      substantial amount of zinc results in two distinctive enzyme species,
      designated as the fast and slow enzymes. Both forms are rapidly reduced by
      substrate methylamine with a rate constant of 199 s(-1) but behave
      remarkably differently in their oxidation rates; the fast enzyme is
      oxidized by dioxygen at a rate of 22.1 s(-1), whereas the slow enzyme
      reacts at a rate of 1.8 x 10(-4) s(-1). The apparent kcat of the enzyme
      preparation is linearly proportional to the fraction of the fast enzyme,
      with an extrapolated value of 6.17 s(-1) when the enzyme is 100% in its
      "fast" form. A comparison of rate constants for cofactor reduction and
      reoxidation steps, measured in stopped flow experiments, to the
      extrapolated kcat implicates additional steps in the steady state
      reaction. Measurement of the proportion of oxidized (ETPQ(ox)) and reduced
      cofactor (ETPQ(red)) under steady state conditions indicates approximately
      50% of each cofactor form at 0.8 or 2 mM methylamine. Kinetic isotope
      effect measurements using deuterated amine substrate lead to the following
      steady state values: (D)(k(red)) = 8.5 (0.5), (D)(kcat) = 1.7 (0.1), and
      (D)(kcat/K(m)) = 4.3 (0.2). The collective data allow the calculation of
      partially rate-determining constants during the reductive half-reaction
      (ca. 200 s(-1) for binding of substrate to ETPQ(ox) and 27.9 s(-1) for
      release of aldehyde product or a protein isomerization from ETPQ(red)); an
      additional step with a rate constant of 13.2 s(-1) is assigned to the
      oxidative half-reaction, most likely for the release of product hydrogen
      peroxide. These results, together with the sole detection of oxidized and
      reduced cofactor during rapid scanning stopped flow experiments, indicate
      that four steps contribute to kcat, with the first electron transfer from
      cofactor to O2 contributing ca. 29%. An investigation of the relationship
      between the copper content and the extent of the fast enzyme shows that
      only the copper-containing homodimer is capable of rapid reoxidation and
      that zinc-copper heterodimers are incapable of rapid turnover at either
      subunit. This implies communication between the metal sites of the two
      subunits per dimer that impacts O2 binding and/or electron transfer from
      reduced cofactor to bound O2.

TI  - Effects of granulocyte colony simulating factor on functional activities
      of endothelial progenitor cells in patients with chronic ischemic heart
      disease.
PG  - 2238-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells
      (EPCs) may contribute to regeneration of infarcted myocardium and enhance
      neovascularization. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is
      well-established to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and might,
      thereby, also increase the pool of endogenously circulating EPC.
      Therefore, we investigated the effects of G-CSF administration on
      mobilization and functional activities of blood-derived EPC in patients
      with chronic ischemic heart disease (CIHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen
      patients with CIHD received 10 microg/kg per day subcutaneous G-CSF
      injection for 5 days. Leukocyte counts, the number of HSCs and EPCs, and
      the migratory response to VEGF and SDF-1 were analyzed before and after
      G-CSF-therapy. At day 5 of G-CSF treatment, the number of circulating
      leukocytes, CD34+ CD45+ and CD34+ CD133+ cells was significantly
      increased. Likewise, G-CSF treatment augmented the numbers of colony
      forming units with endothelial cell morphology (EC-CFU). However, the
      functional activity of the EPC as assessed by the migratory response to
      VEGF and SDF-1 was significantly reduced after G-CSF treatment (P<0.01).
      Because G-CSF was previously shown to cleave the CXCR4 receptor, we
      determined the surface expression of the 6H8 epitope of the CXCR4 receptor
      by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Consistent with the
      reduced migratory capacity, the surface expression of the functionally
      active CXCR4 receptor was significantly reduced. To test the functional
      activity of the cultivated EPCs in vivo, cells were intravenously infused
      in nude mice after hind limb ischemia. EPCs, which were cultivated before
      G-CSF administration, increased blood flow recovery and prevented limb
      necrosis. However, infusion of EPCs, which were isolated 5 days after
      G-CSF treatment from the same patient, showed a reduced capacity to
      augment blood flow recovery and to prevent necrosis by 27%. CONCLUSIONS:
      G-CSF treatment effectively mobilizes HSCs and EPCs. However, the
      migratory response to SDF-1 and in vivo capacity of G-CSF-mobilized EPCs
      was significantly reduced.

TI  - Toxic effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on the small bowel,
      colon, and rectum.
PG  - 286-94
AB  - The gastrointestinal toxicity of conventional nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is not confined to the stomach and
      proximal duodenum but extends also to the rest of the small bowel, colon,
      and rectum. Long-term NSAID therapy usually induces clinically silent
      enteropathy characterized by increased intestinal permeability and
      inflammation. Chronic occult bleeding and protein loss may result in
      iron-deficiency anemia and hypoalbuminemia. NSAIDs can also induce small
      bowel ulcers that infrequently lead to acute bleeding, perforation, or
      chronic scarring responsible for diaphragm-like strictures. At the colon
      and rectum, NSAID use can result in de novo lesions such as nonspecific
      colitis and rectitis, ulcers, and diaphragm-like strictures. NSAIDs have
      been implicated in the development of segmental ischemic colitis. In
      patients with diverticular disease, NSAID use increases the risk of severe
      diverticular infection and perforation. NSAIDs can trigger exacerbations
      of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. With selective COX-2 inhibitors,
      the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity is reduced as compared to
      conventional NSAIDs but is not completely eliminated. Experimental studies
      suggest that long-term COX-2 inhibitor therapy may cause damage to the
      previously healthy small bowel. Similar to conventional NSAIDs, COX-2
      inhibitors may be capable of triggering exacerbations of inflammatory
      bowel disease.

TI  - Parathyroid hormone-related protein regulates tumor-relevant genes in
      breast cancer cells.
PG  - 14563-72
AB  - The effect of endogenous parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) on
      gene expression in breast cancer cells was studied. We suppressed PTHrP
      expression in MDA-MB-231 cells by RNA interference and analyzed changes in
      gene expression by microarray analysis. More than 200 genes showed altered
      expression in response to a PTHrP-specific small interfering (si) RNA
      (siPTHrP). Cell cycle-regulating gene CDC2 and genes (CDC25B and Tome-1)
      that control CDC2 activity showed increased expression in the presence of
      siPTHrP. CDC2 activity was also found to be higher in siPTHrP-treated
      cells. Studies with PTHrP peptides 1-34 and 67-86, forskolin, and a PTH1
      receptor (PTH1R)-specific siRNA showed that PTHrP regulates CDC2 and
      CDC25B, at least in part, via PTH1R in a cAMP-independent manner. Other
      siPTHrP-responsive genes included integrin alpha6 (ITGA6), KISS-1, and
      PAI-1. When combined, siRNAs against ITGA6, PAI-1, and KISS-1 could mimic
      the negative effect of siPTHrP on migration, whereas siKISS-1 and siPTHrP
      similarly reduced the proliferative activity of the cells. Comparative
      expression analyses with 50 primary breast carcinomas revealed that the
      RNA level of ITGA6 correlates with that of PTHrP, and higher CDC2 and
      CDC25B values are found at low PTHrP expression. Our data suggest that
      PTHrP has a profound effect on gene expression in breast cancer cells and,
      as a consequence, contributes to the regulation of important cellular
      activities, such as migration and proliferation.

TI  - High MMP-1 mRNA expression is a risk factor for disease-free and overall
      survivals in patients with invasive breast carcinoma.
PG  - 104-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) degrades extracellular
      matrix and thereby promotes tumor invasion and progression. In this study
      we examined the prognostic significance of tissue expression levels of
      MMP-1 mRNA in patients with invasive breast carcinoma. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We assessed the prognostic value of MMP-1 mRNA expression in
      tumor tissue specimens from 85 breast carcinoma patients with a median
      follow-up time of 38 months (range, 2-48 months). MMP-1 mRNA levels were
      measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
      reaction (real time RT-PCR). The results were correlated with various
      clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: mRNA
      expression levels of MMP-1 were higher in tumor tissue specimens than in
      adjacent normal breast tissue specimens from 15 patients (P < 0.023).
      MMP-1 mRNA levels showed no significant relationship with either tumor
      size or axillary node status but correlated inversely with estrogen
      receptor levels (P < 0.0043). High MMP-1 mRNA expression as determined by
      real-time RT-PCR correlated significantly with a high frequency of
      recurrence and fatal outcome (P < 0.025 and P < 0.020). Multivariate
      analysis using the Cox regression model indicated that high MMP-1 mRNA
      expression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor (risk ratio,
      6.37; P < 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated for the first time the
      high mRNA expression of MMP-1 in patients whose carcinomas lack estrogen
      receptor expression. Our results suggest that MMP-1 is an important gene
      implicated in the progression of human breast cancer.

TI  - Genetic diversity of KIR natural killer cell markers in populations from
      France, Guadeloupe, Finland, Senegal and Reunion.
PG  - 267-76
AB  - Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) belong to a diverse
      family of natural killer (NK) cell receptors recognizing human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) class I molecules. Due to this functional link, KIR
      molecules are expected to display a high polymorphism, such as their HLA
      ligands. Moreover, many studies conducted in mouse and human models have
      shown that NK-KIR receptors play an important role in haematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (HSCT). A beneficial impact of peculiar KIR ligand
      (HLA) mismatching has been reported suggesting a role to this combinatory
      HLA-KIR polymorphism. It is thus important to investigate KIR diversity in
      various human populations. To this end, we used polymerase chain
      reaction-sequence-specific primers to evaluate KIR gene in five selected
      populations (France, Guadeloupe, Senegal, Finland and Reunion). Genotypic
      and haplotypic frequencies were computed, as well as genetic distances and
      dendrogram (phylip package). These data illustrate the genetic
      relationship of these five populations through the KIR polymorphism.
      Results revealed a wide diversity in KIR gene frequencies in Guadeloupe
      and Reunion, and a high specificity in Senegal. The obtained dendrogram
      indicated small genetic distances between France, Guadeloupe and Reunion
      as well as between France and Finland. Senegal showed a distant genetic
      relationship with the other countries and, interestingly, an inverted
      ratio of coding/non-coding (KIR2DS4/1D) alleles compared with Caucasians.
      These data expose the broad diversity in KIR genes worldwide and show that
      KIR genes are pertinent tools in human population genetics. If the role of
      KIR donor-recipient incompatibilities is confirmed, KIR diversity
      according to ethnicity should be taken into account during the selection
      of HSCT donors.

PG  - 1480-9
AB  - The equilibrium and solution structural properties of the iron(III) and
      copper(II) complexes of an asymmetric salen-like ligand
      (N,N'-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-2,3-diamino-propionic acid, H(3)bhbdpa) bearing
      a pendant carboxylate group were characterized in aqueous solution by
      potentiometric, pH-dependent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and
      UV-Vis (UV-Visible) measurements. In the equimolar systems the
      pentadentate ligand forms very stable, differently protonated mononuclear
      complexes with both metal ions. In the presence of iron(III) {NH, PhO(-),
      COO(-)}, {2NH, 2PhO(-), COO(-)} and {2NH, 2PhO(-), COO(-), OH(-)}
      coordinated complexes are dominant. The EPR titrations reflected the
      presence of microscopic complex formation pathways, leading to the
      formation of binding isomers in case of Cu(H(2)bhbdpa)(+), Cu(Hbhbdpa) and
      Cu(bhbdpa)(-). The {2NH, 2PhO(-)+COO(-)/H(2)O} coordinated Cu(bhbdpa) is
      the only species between pH 6-11. At twofold excess of metal ion dinuclear
      complexes were detected with both iron(III) and copper(II). In presence of
      iron(III) a mu-carboxylato-mu-hydroxo-bridged dinuclear complex
      (Fe(2)(bhbdpa)(OH)(3)) is formed from Fe(H(2)bhbdpa)(2+) through
      overlapping proton release processes, providing one of the rare examples
      for the stabilization of an endogenous carboxylate bridged diiron core in
      aqueous solution. The complex Cu(2)(bhbdpa)(+) detected in the presence of
      copper(II) is a paramagnetic (S=1) species with relatively weakly coupled
      metal ions.

TI  - Phenotype of early cardiomyopathic changes induced by active immunization
      of rats with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the second extracellular
      loop of the human beta-adrenergic receptor.
PG  - 209-15
AB  - In the failing human heart, due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, it
      has been suggested that the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR) is a
      potential pathogenic autoantigen. The aim of the present study was to
      investigate whether immunization of rats with a synthetic peptide
      corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the beta1AR (beta1AR
      EC(II)) was able to induce the early stage of cardiomyopathy and also to
      investigate immunological and receptor functional parameters at a
      transcriptional level to permit insights into the autoimmune mechanism in
      cardiomyopathy. Eleven Whistar Fur rats were immunized with a beta1AR
      EC(II) peptide (H26R) once a month during 12 months and seven control rats
      were injected with vehicle according to the same procedure used for the
      immunized group. Cardiac function, beta1AR autoantibodies and their
      functional effects on cardiomyocytes were analysed. beta1AR receptor
      signalling, immunological and cardiomyocyte stretch markers were
      determined on transcriptional level. In H26R immunized rats, beta1AR
      autoantibodies were shown to be present and functionally active, cardiac
      functions in terms of fractional shortening were decreased and
      beta1-adrenergic receptor kinase (GRK2) mRNA were increased compared with
      the control group. These data have shown that immunization of rats with a
      putative antigenic peptide was able to induce an early stage phenotype of
      cardiomyopathy in the form of cardiac dysfunction and up-regulation of
      GRK2 as the first step in the desensitization process of the beta1AR,
      implying the pathological importance of the beta1AR autoantibody.

TI  - Removal of iron and manganese using biological roughing up flow filtration
      technology.
PG  - 4463-75
AB  - The removal of iron and manganese from groundwater using biological
      treatment methods is almost unknown in Latin America. Biological systems
      used in Europe are based on the process of double rapid biofiltration
      during which dissolved oxygen and pH need to be strictly controlled in
      order to limit abiotic iron oxidation. The performance of roughing filter
      technology in a biological treatment process for the removal of iron and
      manganese, without the use of chemical agents and under natural pH
      conditions was studied. Two pilot plants, using two different natural
      groundwaters, were operated with the following treatment line: aeration,
      up flow roughing filtration and final filtration (either slow or rapid).
      Iron and manganese removal efficiencies were found to be between 85% and
      95%. The high solid retention capability of the roughing filter means that
      it is possible to remove iron and manganese simultaneously by biotic and
      abiotic mechanisms. This system combines simple, low-cost operation and
      maintenance with high iron and manganese removal efficiencies, thus
      constituting a technology which is particularly suited to small
      waterworks.

TI  - Actomyosin tension is required for correct recruitment of adherens
      junction components and zonula occludens formation.
PG  - 1637-50
AB  - The adherens junction (AJ) densely associated with actin filaments is a
      major cell-cell adhesion structure. To understand the importance of actin
      filament association in AJ formation, we first analyzed punctate AJs in
      NRK fibroblasts where one actin cable binds to one AJ structure unit. The
      accumulation of AJ components such as the cadherin/catenin complex and
      vinculin, as well as the formation of AJ-associated actin cables depended
      on Rho activity. Inhibitors for the Rho target, ROCK, which regulates
      myosin II activity, and for myosin II ATPase prevented the accumulation of
      AJ components, indicating that myosin II activity is more directly
      involved than Rho activity. Depletion of myosin II by RNAi showed similar
      results. The inhibition of myosin II activity in polarized epithelial
      MTD-1A cells affected the accumulation of vinculin to circumferential AJ
      (zonula adherens). Furthermore, correct zonula occludens (tight junction)
      formation along the apicobasal axis that requires cadherin activity was
      also impaired. Although MDCK cells which are often used as typical
      epithelial cells do not have a typical zonula adherens, punctate AJs
      formed dependently on myosin II activity by inducing wound closure in a
      MDCK cell sheet. These findings suggest that tension generated by
      actomyosin is essential for correct AJ assembly.

TI  - Disruption and restoration of cell-cell junctions in mouse vestibular
      epithelia following aminoglycoside treatment.
PG  - 201-9
AB  - The intracellular junction complexes, which consist of tight junctions
      (TJ), adherens junctions (AJ), and desmosomes, mediate cell-cell adhesion
      in epithelial cells. E-cadherin, which is a major component of AJ, plays a
      role not only in the maintenance of cell-cell junctions, but also in
      repressing cell proliferation. In this study, we examined changes of
      E-cadherin expression in mouse vestibular epithelia following local
      application of neomycin using immunohistochemistry and western blotting,
      and morphology of cell-cell junctions by transmission electron microscopy
      (TEM). Immunohistochemistry and western blotting revealed down-expression
      of E-cadherin and its consecutive recovery. TEM demonstrated temporal
      disruption of cell-cell junctions. Morphology of cell-cell junctions was
      more rapidly restored than recovery of E-cadherin expression. Transient
      disruption of cell-cell junctions and down-expression of E-cadherin is a
      rational response for the deletion of dying hair cells, and may be
      associated with a limited capacity for cell proliferations in mammalian
      vestibular epithelia following their rapid restoration.

TI  - Comparison of whole gene and whole virus scrambled antigen approaches for
      DNA prime and fowlpox virus boost HIV type 1 vaccine regimens in macaques.
PG  - 292-300
AB  - T cell immunity plays a critical role in controlling HIV-1 viremia, and
      encoding a limited set of HIV-1 genes within DNA and poxvirus vectors can,
      when used sequentially, induce high levels of T cell immunity in primates.
      However, a limited breadth of T cell immunity exposes the host to
      potential infection with either genetically diverse HIV-1 strains or T
      cell escape variants of HIV-1. In an attempt to induce maximally broad
      immunity, we examined DNA and recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV) vaccines
      encoding all HIV-1 genes derived from a global HIV-1 consensus sequence,
      but expressed as multiple overlapping scrambled 30-amino acid segments
      (scrambled antigen vaccines, or SAVINEs). Three groups of seven pigtail
      macaques were immunized with sets of DNA and rFPV expressing Gag/Pol
      antigens only, the whole genome SAVINE antigens, or no HIV-1 antigens and
      T cell immunity was monitored by ELISpot and intracellular cytokine
      staining. High levels of cross-subtype HIV-specific T cell immunity to Gag
      were consistently induced in the seven macaques primed with DNA and rFPV
      vaccines expressing Gag/Pol as intact proteins. It was, however, difficult
      to repeatedly boost immunity with further rFPV immunizations, presumably
      reflecting high levels of anti- FPV immunity. Unfortunately, this vaccine
      study did not consistently achieve a broadened level of T cell immunity to
      multiple HIV genes utilizing the novel whole-virus SAVINE approach, with
      only one of seven immunized animals generating broad T cell immunity to
      multiple HIV-1 proteins. Further refinements are planned with alternative
      vector strategies to evaluate the potential of the SAVINE technology.

TI  - Bone alkaline phosphatase besides intact parathyroid hormone in
      hemodialysis patients--any advantage?
PG  - c122-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Bone alkaline phosphatase (bAP) is known to be an
      important biochemical marker of bone formation. Through the present study,
      we intended to find out whether there is any advantage in bAP
      determination, as a routine biochemical marker, besides intact parathyroid
      hormone (iPTH) in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: In a population of 140
      hemodialysis patients, bAP and iPTH were determined on four quarterly
      consecutive occasions. According to the values of iPTH (pg/ml) and bAP
      (ng/ml), patients were divided into four groups: group I: iPTH > 200 and
      bAP > 20, group II: iPTH > 200 and bAP < 20, group III: iPTH < 200 and bAP
      < 20 and group IV: iPTH < 200 and bAP > 20. Patients with higher serum
      phosphorus (P) (group A: P > or = 7 mg/dl) were compared with those with
      lower serum P levels (group B: P < 7 mg/dl). RESULTS: The global
      correlation between iPTH and bAP (total evaluations, n = 503) was 0.32 (p
      < 0.001). Group IV patients tended to show a slight increase of serum
      aluminum (sAl) levels, which were 12.48 +/- 5.35 microg/l higher than in
      the patients from group I (sAl = 9.97 +/- 4.39 microg/l), group II (sAl =
      10.86 +/- 4.45 microg/l) or group III (sAl = 10.92 +/- 3.92 microg/l).
      Significance values (Mann-Whitney) in each group, in comparison with group
      IV, were the following: group I: 0.004; group II: 0.062; group III: <
      0.001. Group A (n = 66) showed higher iPTH levels than group B (n = 430),
      although bAP and sAl were both similar in these two groups of patients
      (Mann-Whitney): iPTH (A) = 631.0 +/- 487.7 vs. iPTH (B) = 253.3 +/- 191.6,
      p < 0.001; bAP (A) = 22.9 +/- 17.4 vs. bAP (B) = 20.4 +/- 13.1, p = n.s.;
      sAl (A) = 10.2 +/- 3.5 vs. sAl (B) = 10.8 +/- 4.4, p = n.s. For similar Al
      and bAP values, group A showed a much stronger iPTH/bAP correlation than
      group B: r = 0.67 (p < 0.001) vs. r = 0.30 (p < 0.001), respectively.
      CONCLUSION: Although iPTH and bAP are frequently in agreement, it seems
      important to separate parathyroid activity given by iPTH, from bone
      remodelling reflected by bAP, in the presence of either a higher aluminum
      exposition or a well-controlled phosphatemia.

TI  - Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations in dogs are inhibited by
      a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist.
PG  - 154-7
AB  - Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation is the major mechanism for
      gastroesophageal reflux. The present study was initiated to investigate
      the potential effect of the metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor
      antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), on transient lower
      esophageal sphincter relaxations in the conscious dog. MPEP (1.4-8.7
      micromol/kg i.v.) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of transient lower
      esophageal sphincter relaxations (59+/-11% inhibition at 8.7 micromol/kg).
      In addition, there was a reduction of the number of reflux episodes and an
      increase in latency time to the occurrence of the first transient lower
      esophageal sphincter relaxation. No effect was seen on basal lower
      esophageal sphincter pressure or on swallowing. It is concluded that the
      mGlu5 receptor antagonist MPEP potently inhibits transient lower
      esophageal sphincter relaxations and that the mGlu5 receptor is a
      potential target for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

TI  - Biphasic versus triphasic oral contraceptives for contraception.
PG  - CD003283
AB  - BACKGROUND: Side effects caused by oral contraceptives discourage
      compliance with, and continuation of, oral contraceptives. A suggested
      disadvantage of biphasic compared to triphasic oral contraceptive pills is
      an increase in breakthrough bleeding. We conducted this systematic review
      to examine this potential disadvantage. OBJECTIVES: To compare biphasic
      with triphasic oral contraceptives in terms of efficacy, cycle control,
      and discontinuation due to side effects. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, LILACS and CENTRAL. We searched the reference
      lists of relevant articles and book chapters. We also contacted the
      authors of relevant studies and pharmaceutical companies in Europe and the
      USA. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials
      comparing any biphasic with any triphasic oral contraceptive when used to
      prevent pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We examined the studies
      found during the searches for possible inclusion and assessed
      methodological quality using Cochrane guidelines. We contacted the authors
      of included studies and of possibly randomized studies for supplemental
      information about the methods and outcomes. We entered the data into
      RevMan. We calculated Peto odds ratios for incidence of discontinuation
      due to medical reasons, intermenstrual bleeding, and absence of withdrawal
      bleeding. MAIN RESULTS: Only two trials of limited quality met our
      inclusion criteria. Larranaga 1978 compared two biphasic pills and one
      triphasic pill, each containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. No
      important differences emerged, and the frequency of discontinuation due to
      medical problems was similar with all three pills. Percival-Smith 1990
      compared a biphasic pill containing norethindrone (Ortho 10/11) with a
      triphasic pill containing levonorgestrel (Triphasil) and with another
      triphasic containing norethindrone (Ortho 7/7/7). The biphasic pill had
      inferior cycle control compared with the levonorgestrel triphasic. The
      odds ratio of cycles with intermenstrual bleeding was 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 to
      2.2) for the biphasic compared with the triphasic levonorgestrel pill. The
      odds ratio of cycles without withdrawal bleeding was 6.5 (95% CI 3.1 to
      13). In contrast, cycle control with the biphasic pill was comparable to
      that of the triphasic containing the same progestin (norethindrone).
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence is limited and the internal
      validity of these trials is questionable. Given the high losses to follow
      up, these reports may even be considered observational. Given that caveat,
      the biphasic pill containing norethindrone was associated with inferior
      cycle control compared with the triphasic pill containing levonorgestrel.
      The choice of progestin may be more important than the phasic regimen in
      determining bleeding patterns.

TI  - Glomerular pathology of allograft kidneys in Hong Kong.
PG  - 4293-6
AB  - AIMS: Our goal was to define the spectrum of glomerular diseases in
      allograft kidneys and to correlate them with clinical parameters. METHODS:
      Eight hundred ninety-one renal graft biopsies and 43 graft nephrectomies
      from 1980 to 2004 were obtained from 442 allografts transplanted to 425
      patients. RESULTS: Glomerular diseases were diagnosed in 33% of kidney
      grafts. Indications for biopsy were baseline assessment (23 biopsies,
      2.5%); renal dysfunction (790 biopsies, 88.7%); proteinuria (154 biopsies,
      17.3%); hematuria (11 biopsies, 1.2%); and study protocol (four biopsies,
      0.4%). The median time to take a biopsy was less than 8 months
      posttransplant. The mean time posttransplant when the biopsy diagnosis was
      made was 70 months for IgA nephropathy (IgAN); 66 months for transplant
      glomerulopathy (TG); 65 months for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
      (FSG); 55 months for mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (MCGN); 45
      months for membranous glomerulonephritis (GN); 49 months for mesangial
      proliferative GN; and 101 months for diabetic nephropathy. Recurrent
      glomerular disease was documented in 31 (7.0%) grafts. Specific glomerular
      diseases were diagnosed by biopsies in 106 (89.1%) of 119 proteinuric
      allografts. CONCLUSIONS: Glomerulopathy was common in allografted kidneys.
      IgAN, TG, FSG, mesangial proliferative GN, and membranous GN were the
      majority. A higher proportion of grafts from donors related to the
      recipients than from unrelated donors showed IgAN (P < .05), suggesting
      that genetic factors might play a role in the pathogenesis of IgAN.
      Recurrence of glomerulopathy underlying ESRD was frequent for IgAN, FSG,
      and MCGN, but this was rarely seen in membranous GN.

TI  - Assessment of health-related quality of life in children with cancer:
      consistency and agreement between parent and child reports.
PG  - 2267-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: In pediatric settings, measures of health-related quality of
      life (HRQL) are often obtained by proxy, especially from parents, but the
      correlation between parental report and patient report has not been
      clearly established. In the current study, the authors examined the
      agreement between child and parent reports of HRQL in children with cancer
      (both those receiving treatment and those off treatment) and healthy
      controls. METHODS: Two groups of children with cancer who differed with
      regard to treatment status (n = 199) and a group of healthy control
      children (n = 108) were assessed using a standardized measure of HRQL.
      Both children and parents reported on the child's HRQL using parallel
      forms of the Children's Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: Significant
      parent-child correlations were found for all 10 HRQL scales, and these
      correlations were higher in the cancer groups compared with controls.
      Parents in the cancer groups tended to underestimate the HRQL of their
      children compared with the child report, although there were no
      significant parent-child mean differences in the group of patients who
      were off treatment and only 2 significant differences in the group of
      children receiving treatment. In contrast, parents in the control group
      tended to overestimate the HRQL of their children, and the parent-child
      differences were found to be larger, achieving statistical significance on
      8 of 10 scales. CONCLUSIONS: Parents and children tend to report
      comparable child HRQL outcomes, and this is particularly true in oncology
      populations. In cases in which the child is either too young or too ill to
      provide a self-report, parent-reported HRQL can be viewed as a reliable
      substitute.

TI  - Recent findings concerning thiazolidinediones in the treatment of
      diabetes.
PG  - 243-50
AB  - Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor
      (PPAR)-gamma agonists. They increase insulin action through several
      mechanisms including: stimulation of the expression of genes that increase
      fat oxidation and lower plasma free fatty acid levels; increased
      expression, synthesis and release of adiponectin; and stimulation of
      adipocyte differentiation resulting in more and smaller fat cells. TZDs
      lower blood sugar comparably to sulfonylureas and metformin. The clinical
      use of TZDs is limited due to the long duration of time required before
      they reach their full blood sugar-lowering action (3-4 months) and adverse
      effects such as fluid retention, resulting in excessive weight gain and
      occasionally in peripheral and/or pulmonary oedema and congestive heart
      failure. Troglitazone, a TZD that has since been removed from the market
      because of hepatoxicity, has been demonstrated to decrease the progression
      from normal or impaired glucose tolerance to overt Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Pioglitazone, another TZD, marginally decreased the incidence of
      cardiovascular complications in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (PROactive trial). Other, as yet, unapproved uses of TZDs include:
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in which TZDs reduced hepatic fat
      accumulation and improved liver function tests; polycystic ovary syndrome,
      where TZDs improved ovulation, hirsutism and endothelial dysfunction; and
      lipodystrophies, where TZDs increased body fat (marginally) and decrease
      liver size. Lastly, because PPAR-alpha and -gamma agonists improve
      atherosclerotic vascular disease and insulin sensitivity, respectively,
      dual PPAR-alpha/gamma agonists, which are currently undergoing clinical
      trials, may be useful in treating patients with the metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Common cancer biomarkers.
PG  - 2953-61
AB  - There is an increasing interest in complementing conventional
      histopathologic evaluation with molecular tools that could increase the
      sensitivity and specificity of cancer staging for diagnostic and
      prognostic purposes. This study strove to identify cancer-specific markers
      for the molecular detection of a broad range of cancer types. We used 373
      archival samples inclusive of normal tissues of various lineages and
      benign or malignant tumors (predominantly colon, melanoma, ovarian, and
      esophageal cancers). All samples were processed identically and
      cohybridized with an identical reference RNA source to a custom-made cDNA
      array platform. The database was split into training (n = 201) and
      comparable prediction (n = 172) sets. Leave-one-out cross-validation and
      gene pairing analysis identified putative cancer biomarkers overexpressed
      by malignant lesions independent of tissue of derivation. In particular,
      seven gene pairs were identified with high predictive power (87%) in
      segregating malignant from benign lesions. Receiver operator
      characteristic curves based on the same genes could segregate malignant
      from benign tissues with 94% accuracy. The relevance of this study rests
      on the identification of a restricted number of biomarkers ubiquitously
      expressed by cancers of distinct histology. This has not been done before.
      These biomarkers could be used broadly to increase the sensitivity and
      accuracy of cancer staging and early detection of locoregional or systemic
      recurrence. Their selective expression by cancerous compared with paired
      normal tissues suggests an association with the oncogenic process
      resulting in stable expression during disease progression when the
      presently used differentiation markers are unreliable.

TI  - Giant flow reversal in pulmonary venous flow as a possible mechanism for
      asynchronous pacing-induced heart failure.
PG  - 722-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanistic roles of the immediate increase in left atrial
      (LA) pressure in pacing-induced congestive heart failure have not been
      clearly understood. We evaluated the impact of asynchronous rapid
      ventricular pacing on LA hemodynamics in this model. METHODS:
      Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography and hemodynamic
      assessment were performed in 23 healthy mongrel dogs. Data were acquired
      before and 5 minutes after initiation of rapid right ventricular pacing
      (200/min). RESULTS: At 5 minutes after initiation of the pacing, giant
      pulmonary venous (PV) flow reversal (-76 cm/s) was observed in association
      with 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction or complete atrioventricular
      dissociation. This giant PV flow reversal corresponded to an
      inappropriately timed atrial contraction, especially during systole.
      Cardiac output (3.21 vs 2.00 L/min, P < .001) was decreased corresponding
      to the decrease in the forward blood volumes as described by decrease in
      the Doppler left ventricular (LV) outflow (8.99 vs 4.73 cm, P < .0001),
      mitral inflow (6.89 vs 3.19 cm, P < .0001), and PV flow (14.15 vs 7.22 cm,
      P < .0001) velocity integrals. As a result, there was a marked elevation
      of the mean pulmonary capillary wedge (9.1 vs 17.1 mm Hg, P < .001) and LV
      end-diastolic (8.2 vs 17.4 mm Hg, P < .01) pressures leading to congestive
      heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: The giant PV flow reversal seen during
      asynchronous rapid right ventricular pacing corresponds to an
      inappropriate atrial contraction, immediately elevates LA pressure, and
      may initially promote congestive heart failure. The increase in LV
      end-diastolic pressure associated with decreased LV ejection fraction
      caused decrease in the LV filling volume leading to further increase in
      the LA pressure. This sustained marked elevation in the LA pressure and LV
      end-diastolic pressure could contribute to the heart failure process.

TI  - Congenital absence of the pericardium: case presentation and review of
      literature.
PG  - 21-5
AB  - Congenital absence of the pericardium is an uncommon finding that may or
      may not be symptomatic. Asymptomatic patients are discovered incidentally
      during cardiac surgery for an unrelated condition or postmortem. However,
      symptomatic patients may experience non-exertional paroxysmal stabbing
      chest pain. It may occur with other cardiac or extracardiac abnormalities
      and a variety of imaging modalities may identify the condition. Complete
      cases are more rare than partial effects. However, complications are more
      common with partial absence due to strangulation of the heart into the
      defect thus requiring surgical intervention.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using navigation: a comparative
      study on 60 patients.
PG  - 542-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor outcome in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is
      often related to tunnel position. HYPOTHESIS: Improving accuracy of the
      tunnel position will lead to improved outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized
      controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Sixty patients were
      randomized to either standard instrumentation or computer-assisted guides
      to position the tibial and femoral tunnels. The results were evaluated on
      clinical outcome based on International Knee Documentation Committee form
      (laxity) and radiologic assessment: radiologic Lachman (Telos at 150 and
      200 N) and analysis of the tunnel positions. RESULTS: International Knee
      Documentation Committee laxity was level A in 22 knees in the conventional
      group (mean, 1.5 mm at 200 N) compared with 26 navigated knees (mean
      laxity, 1.3 mm; P = .49). Laxity was less than 2 mm in 96.7% of the
      navigated group and 83% of the conventional group (P = .292). The
      variability of laxity in the navigated group was significantly less than
      in the conventional group, with the standard deviation of the navigated
      group being smaller than that in the conventional group (P = .0003 at 150
      N and .0005 at 200 N Telos). A significant difference (P = .03) was found
      between the groups in the ATB value (distance between the projection of
      the Blumensaat line on the tibial plateau and the anterior edge of the
      tibial tunnel), characterizing the sagittal position of the tibial tunnel
      (negative ATB values imply graft impingement in extension). In the
      conventional group, mean ATB was -0.2 (-5 to +4), whereas it was 0.4 (0 to
      3) in the navigated patients. There were no negative ATB values in the
      navigated group. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the accuracy and
      consistency of tibial tunnel position can be improved by the use of
      computer-assisted navigation and that the clinical result in terms of
      laxity is more reliable.

TI  - A herd level analysis of urinary tract infection in dairy cattle.
PG  - 172-6
AB  - Cystitis, urethritis and pyelonephritis in cattle most commonly result
      from ascending urinary tract infection with Corynebacterium renale,
      Corynebacterium cystidis, Corynebacterium pilosum or Escherichia coli. We
      describe the clinical, bacteriological, clinical-pathological and
      epidemiological findings in a dairy cattle herd with urinary tract
      infection (UTI). Blood and urine samples from 17 calves and 19 cows were
      submitted to laboratory examinations. Depression, muscle wasting, weakness
      and frequent urine dribbling were the main characteristics of UTI in
      calves. Affected cows showed weight loss and an abrupt reduction in feed
      intake and milk production. Enlargement of the left kidney and loss of
      normal lobulation were evident on rectal examination. E. coli was the most
      frequent cause of UTI but C. renale, alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus spp.,
      Proteus spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Oligella
      urethralis were isolated as well. Differences in total protein and several
      protein fractions were found between affected and healthy animals.

TI  - Treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome and CIDP.
PG  - 113-27
AB  - Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating
      poly-(radiculo)neuropathy (CIDP) are immune-mediated disorders with a
      variable duration of progression and a range in severity of weakness.
      Infections can trigger GBS and exacerbate CIDP. Anti-ganglioside
      antibodies are important, but there is debate on the role of genetic
      factors in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Randomized controlled
      trials (RCT) have shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma
      exchange (PE) are effective in both GBS and CIDP. Most CIDP patients also
      improve after steroid therapy. Despite current treatment options, many
      patients have residual deficits or need to be treated for a long period of
      time. Therefore, new treatment trials are highly indicated. This review
      focuses on the current and possible new treatment options that could be
      guided by recent results from laboratory experiments.

TI  - Disruption of Nrf2 enhances susceptibility to severe airway inflammation
      and asthma in mice.
PG  - 47-59
AB  - Oxidative stress has been postulated to play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of asthma; although a defect in antioxidant responses has
      been speculated to exacerbate asthma severity, this has been difficult to
      demonstrate with certainty. Nuclear erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2
      (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive basic leucine zipper transcription factor that
      is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many antioxidant genes.
      We show that disruption of the Nrf2 gene leads to severe allergen-driven
      airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in mice. Enhanced asthmatic
      response as a result of ovalbumin sensitization and challenge in
      Nrf2-disrupted mice was associated with more pronounced mucus cell
      hyperplasia and infiltration of eosinophils into the lungs than seen in
      wild-type littermates. Nrf2 disruption resulted in an increased expression
      of the T helper type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 in
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in splenocytes after allergen challenge.
      The enhanced severity of the asthmatic response from disruption of the
      Nrf2 pathway was a result of a lowered antioxidant status of the lungs
      caused by lower basal expression, as well as marked attenuation, of the
      transcriptional induction of multiple antioxidant genes. Our studies
      suggest that the responsiveness of Nrf2-directed antioxidant pathways may
      act as a major determinant of susceptibility to allergen-mediated asthma.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms for maintenance of G-rich short tandem repeats
      capable of adopting G4 DNA structures.
PG  - 120-31
AB  - Mammalian genomes contain several types of repetitive sequences. Some of
      these sequences are implicated in various specific cellular events,
      including meiotic recombination, chromosomal breaks and transcriptional
      regulation, and also in several human disorders. In this review, we
      document the formation of DNA secondary structures by the G-rich
      repetitive sequences that have been found in several minisatellites,
      telomeres and in various triplet repeats, and report their effects on in
      vitro DNA synthesis. d(GGCAG) repeats in the mouse minisatellite Pc-1 were
      demonstrated to form an intra-molecular folded-back quadruplex structure
      (also called a G4' structure) by NMR and CD spectrum analyses. d(TTAGGG)
      telomere repeats and d(CGG) triplet repeats were also shown to form G4'
      and other unspecified higher order structures, respectively. In vitro DNA
      synthesis was substantially arrested within the repeats, and this could be
      responsible for the preferential mutability of the G-rich repetitive
      sequences. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using NIH3T3 cell
      extracts revealed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 and
      A3, which were tightly and specifically bound to d(GGCAG) and d(TTAGGG)
      repeats with K(d) values in the order of nM. HnRNP A1 unfolded the G4'
      structure formed in the d(GGCAG)(n) and d(TTAGGG)(n) repeat regions, and
      also resolved the higher order structure formed by d(CGG) triplet repeats.
      Furthermore, DNA synthesis arrest at the secondary structures of d(GGCAG)
      repeats, telomeres and d(CGG) triplet repeats was efficiently repressed by
      the addition of hnRNP A1. High expression of hnRNPs may contribute to the
      maintenance of G-rich repetitive sequences, including telomere repeats,
      and may also participate in ensuring the stability of the genome in cells
      with enhanced proliferation. Transcriptional regulation of genes, such as
      c-myc and insulin, by G4 sequences found in the promoter regions could be
      an intriguing field of research and help further elucidate the biological
      functions of the hnRNP family of proteins in human diseases.

TI  - Direct visualization of the human subthalamic nucleus with 3T MR imaging.
PG  - 80-4
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus
      (STN) is an accepted treatment for advanced Parkinson disease (PD).
      Although procedural details are well established, targeting STN remains
      problematic because of its variable location and relatively small size
      (20-30 mm(3)). A combination of anatomic imaging with a stereotactic
      frame, atlas coordinates, and intraoperative neurophysiology is currently
      considered the most reliable approach for STN targeting. CT imaging is
      dependent on atlas coordinates, because the STN is not visualized. The STN
      is also difficult to visualize directly by using MR imaging at 1.5 T.
      METHODS: We performed preoperative stereotactic MR imaging at 3T to
      visualize the STN in 13 patients undergoing deep-brain stimulation for PD.
      With the patient positioned within a standard Leksell type G stereotactic
      frame localizer, rapidly acquired scout images are used to prescribe
      volumes of contiguous high-resolution T2-weighted fast spin-echo images in
      the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes through the midbrain and basal
      ganglia. The STN is identified in all 3 planes by cross-referencing in a
      3-plane viewer. These coordinates are used for surgical targeting.
      RESULTS: At 3T, the STN was visualized as a small, hypointense,
      almond-shaped structure in 3 planes located immediately lateral to the
      anterior edge of the red nucleus, medial to the internal capsule, about 5
      mm inferior, 1-2 mm posterior, and 9-12 mm lateral to the midcommissural
      point. Intraoperative microelectrode recordings confirmed these
      coordinates in all cases from the first microelectrode pass, thereby
      eliminating prolonged intraoperative electrophysiological STN searching
      and tissue disruption that may occur from multiple passes. CONCLUSION: 3T
      MR imaging appears to be an excellent tool for reliable and accurate
      direct visualization of the human STN, necessary for precise surgical
      targeting.

TI  - Ghrelin levels in young children with Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the hypothesis that high ghrelin levels contribute
      to obesity in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), we assessed whether the
      increased levels observed in older persons with PWS exist in very young
      children, before the onset of hyperphagia. STUDY DESIGN: We measured
      ghrelin levels in nine children with PWS (17-60 months of age) and eight
      healthy control subjects of equivalent body mass index (BMI), age, and
      sex. RESULTS: PWS and control groups had equivalent BMI (16.8 +/- 1.4 vs
      16.1 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2), respectively; P = .24), age (37.8 +/- 15.4 vs 50.3
      +/- 17.7 months; P = .14), and sex. PWS and control groups also had
      equivalent fasting levels of total ghrelin (787 +/- 242 vs 716 +/- 135
      pg/mL, respectively; P = .24), bioactive ghrelin (102 +/- 35 vs 91 +/- 23
      pg/mL; P = .45), insulin, and glucose. Ghrelin correlated negatively with
      BMI among controls (r = -0.760, P = .029) but not PWS (r = 0.015, P =
      .97). CONCLUSIONS: Children <5 years of age with PWS, who had not yet
      developed hyperphagia or excessive obesity, had normal ghrelin levels, in
      contrast with the hyperghrelinemia of older, hyperphagic people with PWS.
      It is possible that ghrelin levels increase suddenly before hyperphagia
      develops.

      disease].
PG  - 385-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of intratympanic dexamethasone
      injections (IDI) for 15 patients with intractable Meniere's disease (MD).
      METHOD: Dexamethasone (2.5 mg/0.5 ml) was injected into the middle ear and
      followed by a second injection 15 minutes later. The injection was
      repeated the next day and weekly for 3 weeks. Total dose of dexamethasone
      was 17.5 mg. RESULT: The 15 patients were followed up for 18 months
      (average). Complete relief of vertigo was maintained in 10 cases, improved
      in 2 case, injection wos repeated 3 patients with recurrent vertigo
      resulted in control of vertigo. Tinnitus disappeared in 5 cases, reduced
      in 5 cases, unchanged in 5 cases. Hearing was improved in 10 cases,
      unchanged in 5 cases. CONCLUSION: IDI is effective for intractable MD. The
      benefits of IDI are avoidance of systemic use of steroids, lower cost,
      easy application. IDI can be used as an initial surgical treatment for
      persistent vertigo in MD and indicated for bilateral MD.

TI  - The extract of syngeneic keratinocytes enhances IgE production from BALB/c
      mouse splenic lymphocytes in vitro.
PG  - 358-66
AB  - The increase of serum IgE levels is closely associated with atopic
      dermatitis. We have previously revealed that cellular extract of PAM212
      cells (PAM-extract), BALB/c mouse keratinocyte cell line, induced a
      remarkable increase of serum IgE levels, in vivo, when subcutaneously
      injected into BALB/c mice. However, precise mechanism of IgE-increasing
      activity was unclear. To elucidate the mechanism of IgE-increase in sera
      of BALB/c mice induced by PAM-extract, we explored the direct influence of
      PAM-extract on immunoglobulin production and class-switching in the
      culture of splenic lymphocytes and purified B-cells, in vitro. Splenic
      lymphocytes or purified B-cells obtained from BALB/c mice were cultured
      with various combinations of IL-4, anti-CD40 antibody, and PAM-extract for
      7 days. IgE and IgG concentrations of culture supernatants were measured
      by ELISA. Epsilon germ-line transcriptions were assessed by RT-PCR from
      the cultured cells. IgE and IgG concentrations in culture supernatant of
      splenic lymphocytes were increased by an addition of PAM-extract in the
      presence of both IL-4 and anti-CD40 antibody. Epsilon germ-line transcript
      was also induced in parallel to the increase of IgE production. Similar
      results were obtained when purified B-cells were employed in stead of
      whole splenic lymphocytes. The enhancement of IgE production in vitro was
      also observed, when splenic lymphocytes of CBAj mouse were cultured with
      cellular extract of KCMH-1 cells, CBAj mouse keratinocyte cell line. The
      cellular extract of keratinocyte promotes immunoglobulin class-switching
      to IgE and IgE production from mouse splenic B-cells in an IL-4- and
      CD40-stimuli-dependent manner. Such enhancement may account for the
      increase of serum IgE in patients with dermatitis in association with a
      Th2 microenvironment.

TI  - Urinary t,t-muconic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid and benzene as
      biomarkers of low benzene exposure.
PG  - 253-6
AB  - This research compared the capability of urinary trans,trans-muconic acid
      (t,t-MA), S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) and benzene excreted in urine
      (U-benzene) to monitor low benzene exposure and evaluated the influence of
      smoking habit on these indices. Gasoline attendants, urban policemen, bus
      drivers and two groups of referents working in two large Italian cities
      (415 people) were studied. Median benzene exposure was 61, 22, 21, 9 and 6
      microg/m3, respectively, with higher levels in workers than in referents.
      U-benzene, but not t,t-MA and S-PMA, showed an exposure-related increase.
      All the biomarkers were strongly influenced by cigarette smoking, with
      values up to five-fold higher in smokers compared to non-smokers. In
      conclusion, in the range of investigated benzene exposure (<478 microg/m3
      or <0.15 ppm), the smoking habit may be regarded as a major source of
      benzene intake; among the study indices, U-benzene is the marker of choice
      for the biological monitoring of occupational and environmental exposure.

TI  - Analysis of colonoscopic findings in the differential diagnosis between
      intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 592-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease are
      chronic inflammatory bowel disorders that are difficult to differentiate
      from one another. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of
      various colonoscopic findings in the differential diagnosis between
      intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Colonoscopic findings on initial work-up were prospectively recorded in
      patients with an initial diagnosis of either intestinal tuberculosis or
      Crohn's disease. These findings were analyzed after a final diagnosis of
      intestinal tuberculosis (n = 44) or Crohn's disease (n = 44) had been made
      after follow-up. RESULTS: Four parameters (anorectal lesions, longitudinal
      ulcers, aphthous ulcers, and cobblestone appearance) were significantly
      more common in patients with Crohn's disease than in patients with
      intestinal tuberculosis. Four other parameters (involvement of fewer than
      four segments, a patulous ileocecal valve, transverse ulcers, and scars or
      pseudopolyps) were observed more frequently in patients with intestinal
      tuberculosis than in patients with Crohn's disease. We hypothesized that a
      diagnosis of Crohn's disease could be made when the number of parameters
      characteristic of Crohn's disease was higher than the number of parameters
      characteristic of intestinal tuberculosis, and vice versa. Making these
      assumptions, we calculated that the diagnosis of either intestinal
      tuberculosis or Crohn's disease would have been made made correctly in 77
      of our 88 patients (87.5 %), incorrectly in seven patients (8.0 %), and
      would not have been made in four patients (4.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: A
      systematic analysis of colonoscopic findings is very useful in the
      differential diagnosis between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's
      disease.

PG  - 506-13
AB  - Treatment results and prognostic factors for 80 patients with oral tongue
      cancer admitted to Istanbul University Oncology Institute between 1987 and
      2000 were retrospectively analysed. The patients were treated by surgery
      and postoperative or curative radiotherapy. Median age was 55 (22-93) out
      of which 41 patients (51%) were male and 39 (49%) were female. One patient
      (1%) had stage I disease, 28 patients (36%) stage II, 18 patients (23%)
      stage III and 32 patients (40%) stage IVA disease. Nineteen patients (24%)
      were medically inoperable or refused surgical treatment, so were treated
      with curative radiotherapy to a total dose of 70Gy (group A). The
      remaining 61 patients (76%) were treated with surgery and postoperative
      external beam radiotherapy (group B). The median follow-up time was 44
      months. The 5-year overall and loco-regional disease-free survival rates
      were 42% and 46%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates were 16%
      in group A and 49% in group B (P=0.0002). The 5-year disease-specific
      survival rate was 23% in group A while in group B it was 49%; the
      difference was statistically significant (P=0.02). Combined treatment
      improves overall and disease-free survival in patients with stage II, III
      and IVA oral tongue cancer. In patients who are not candidates for
      surgery, the effect of radiotherapy may be increased with the use of
      brachytherapy.

TI  - Sustained low-level expression of interferon-gamma promotes tumor
      development: potential insights in tumor prevention and tumor
      immunotherapy.
PG  - 891-7
AB  - Although the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has
      been generally thought to enhance antitumor immune responses and be
      involved in antitumor mechanisms of many other immunotherapy molecules, it
      has also been reported that IFN-gamma could promote tumor immune evasion.
      In this report, by using an ideal mouse model that expresses IFN-gamma
      locally in muscle, we demonstrate that sustained low-level expression of
      IFN-gamma promotes the development of several types of tumor including H22
      hepatoma, MA782/5S mammary adenocarcinoma and B16 melanoma. However,
      transitory expression of IFN-gamma does not have such an effect. On the
      other hand, sustained high-level expression of IFN-gamma mediates
      significant antitumor effect on H22 hepatoma. Low level of IFN-gamma
      upregulates expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4 and Foxp3, which may partly
      account for the tumor immune evasion promoted by IFN-gamma. Furthermore,
      blockade of PD-L inhibits IFN-gamma's tumor-promoting effect. Our findings
      provide a mechanistic link between chronic inflammation and cancer and
      would have potential implications for cancer prevention and also for the
      design of cytokine-based cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Presence of glucosylceramide in yeast and its relation to alkali tolerance
      of yeast.
PG  - 515-21
AB  - Glycosylceramide is a membrane lipid that has physiological functions in
      eukaryotic organisms. The presence of glucosylceramide has been confirmed
      in some yeast; however, the extent of the role of glucosylceramide in
      yeast is unknown. Thus, the extent of presence of glucosylceramide in
      yeast was surveyed using 90 strains of 24 genera. The strains were divided
      into two groups according to whether they had glucosylceramide (45
      strains) or not (45 strains). The distribution of the ceramide
      glucosyltransferase gene (EC 2.4.1.80), which catalyzes glucosylation to a
      sphingoid lipid in glucosylceramide synthesis, and the phylogenetic
      classification of the strains were in agreement with those of
      glucosylceramide. Thus, the presence of glucosylceramide in yeast was
      caused by the presence of the gene involved in glucosylceramide synthesis
      and was closely associated with yeast evolution. Furthermore, the
      relationship between glucosylceramide presence and alkali tolerance of
      yeast was evaluated. The yeast with glucosylceramide tended to grow at
      higher pH, and a ceramide-glucosyltransferase-defective mutant from
      Kluyveromyces lactis did not grow at pH 8.5 even though the parent strain
      could grow under the same conditions. These results indicate that
      glucosylceramide in yeast might be a component that enables yeast to grow
      under alkali conditions.

TI  - Endocrine control of Anguilla anguilla glass eel dispersal: effect of
      thyroid hormones on locomotor activity and rheotactic behavior.
PG  - 53-63
AB  - Dispersal, one of the most important processes in population ecology, is
      an issue linking physiological and behavioral features. However, the
      endocrine control of animal dispersal remains poorly understood. Here, we
      tested whether and how thyroid hormones may influence dispersal in glass
      eels of Anguilla anguilla, by testing their influence on locomotor
      activity and rheotactic behavior. Glass eels were caught during their
      estuarine migration and treated by immersion in either a l-thyroxine
      (T(4)) or a thiourea (TU) solution. As measured by radioimmunoassay, T(4)
      and TU treatments induced, respectively, increased and decreased
      whole-body thyroid hormone levels relative to untreated controls. We
      tested a total of 960 glass eels distributed into control, and T(4) and TU
      treatment groups, on their swimming behavior in experimental flume tanks
      equipped with upstream and downstream traps that allowed us to
      concurrently measure both the locomotor activity and the rheotactic
      behavior. Compared to controls, locomotor activity significantly increased
      among the hyperthyroid, T(4)-treated eels, but significantly decreased
      among the hypothyroid, TU-treated eels. The results on rheotactic behavior
      suggested a more complex regulatory mechanism, since TU but not T(4)
      treatment significantly affected rheotactic behavior. The influence of
      thyroid hormones on locomotor activity suggests a central role for these
      hormones in the regulation of mechanisms leading to the colonization of
      continental habitats by glass eels. Thyroid hormones are also implicated
      in the control of locomotor activity in mammals and migratory behavior in
      birds, suggesting that these hormones represent conserved, proximate
      mediators of dispersal in vertebrates.

TI  - The temporal stability of arsenic concentrations in well water in western
      Nevada.
PG  - 164-8
AB  - Millions of people worldwide are exposed to drinking water containing
      arsenic, and epidemiologic studies have identified associations between
      the ingestion of arsenic-contaminated water and increased risks of cancer.
      In many of these studies, the assessment of arsenic exposure is based on a
      limited number of drinking water measurements, and the assessment of
      long-term or past exposure relies on the assumption that arsenic
      concentrations in sources of drinking water remain stable over time. In
      this investigation, the temporal stability of arsenic concentration was
      assessed in 759 wells in western Nevada state in the USA. Arsenic
      concentrations in these wells ranged from nondetectable to 6200 microg/L
      (median, 10 microg/L; standard deviation, 335 microg/L). Spearman
      correlation coefficients between arsenic concentrations measured in the
      same wells over a period of 1--5, 6--10, and 11--20 years apart were,
      respectively, 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81--0.86), 0.85 (95%
      CI, 0.81--0.88), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88--0.96). These findings suggest
      that, in this study area, arsenic concentrations in most wells remain
      stable over time and a limited number of measurements per well can be used
      to predict arsenic exposures over a period of many years.

TI  - Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia versus usual interstitial pneumonia:
      differences in the density histogram of high-resolution CT.
PG  - 544-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the capability of the density histogram of
      high-resolution CT (HRCT) in differentiating nonspecific interstitial
      pneumonia (NSIP) from usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) without definite
      honeycombing. METHODS: Twenty-eight NSIP and 32 UIP patients without
      definite honeycombing on CT were included in this study. We evaluated a CT
      image at the level of 1 cm above the diaphragm. The pixels of the lung
      parenchyma were classified into 4 ranges. The fractions of each range of
      corresponding density were calculated. The skewness (the degree of
      asymmetry of a distribution) and kurtosis (how sharply peaked a histogram
      is) were obtained from the density histogram. The mean value and the mode
      value of the lung attenuation were also measured. RESULTS: The fraction of
      the range of ground-glass opacity and reticular opacity was greater in
      NSIP patients (32%, 12%) than in UIP patients (23%, 8%) (P < 0.001). UIP
      had a larger fraction of the range of normal lung. The density histogram
      was less skewed (P = 0.01) and had a wider peak (P = 0.02) in NSIP
      (skewness = 1.2879 +/- 0.5672, kurtosis = 1.2115 +/- 1.9470) than in UIP
      (skewness = 1.6426 +/- 0.4664, kurtosis = 2.3880 +/- 1.8183). CONCLUSION:
      The density histogram reflected the differences in the CT features between
      NSIP and UIP. Therefore, a density histogram may be helpful for
      differentiating NSIP from UIP without definite honeycombing.

TI  - Prostate cancer susceptibility is mediated by interactions between
      exposure to ultraviolet radiation and polymorphisms in the 5' haplotype
      block of the vitamin D receptor gene.
PG  - 328-35
AB  - Vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms are prostate cancer risk
      candidates. We determined if SNPs in haplotype block sub-regions C2 (SNPs
      C2-1, G/C(3436), C2-2, A/G(3944)) or C1 (C1-1, C/T(20965), C1-2,
      C/T(30056)) are associated with risk in an ultraviolet radiation
      (UVR)-dependent manner. In men with very low exposure, SNPs in both
      sub-regions were associated with risk. Various haplotypes in haplotype
      block C including G(3436)-A(3944)-C(20965)-C(30056), (G or C)-A-C-C and
      G-A-(C or T)-C were significantly associated with increased risk (odds
      ratios between 1.95 and 2.37). These findings suggest various block C SNPs
      are associated with prostate cancer risk via a mechanism involving
      exposure to sunlight.

TI  - Differential effect of interleukin-2 treatment on primary and secondary
      immunizations in HIV infected individuals.
PG  - 1967-74
AB  - OBJECTIVES: As interleukin (IL)-2 therapy increases CD4 cell counts in HIV
      infected subjects, it emerged as a candidate for the partial restoration
      of immune competence in this disease. METHODS: We studied the frequencies
      of antigen-specific T cells using single cell resolution cytokine ELISPOT
      assays and titers of specific antibodies before and after immunization of
      HIV infected subjects who were treated with HAART or HAART plus IL-2.
      RESULTS: Subjects seronegative to hepatitis A were vaccinated with
      hepatitis A antigen. In the non-IL-2 treated group, hepatitis A-specific T
      cells producing IL-2 and IL-4 along with specific antibodies were induced,
      showing that these subjects are immune competent and capable of mounting a
      primary immune response. Additional IL-2 treatment had no significant
      effect on this primary T cell response; however, booster immunizations
      with tetanus toxoid or the gp120 depleted HIV vaccine Remune induced
      higher frequencies of specific interferon (IFN)-gamma producing T cells in
      IL-2 treated subjects. No impact of IL-2 treatment on these secondary B
      cell responses was seen. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study showed that IL-2
      therapy had no immune enhancing effect on the induction of a primary
      response, but increased the frequency of IFN-gamma producing memory cells
      after booster immunization.

TI  - Papanicolaou tests with mixed high-grade and low-grade squamous
      intraepithelial lesion features: distinct performance in the College of
      American Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Cervicovaginal
      Cytopathology.
PG  - 456-9
AB  - CONTEXT: Previous studies have shown that in gynecologic cytology, cases
      of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high-grade
      squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) perform differently on interpretive
      review. The performance of cases with mixed LSIL and HSIL features is
      unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of gynecologic cytology
      cases of "pure" LSIL and HSIL with cases showing mixed LSIL and HSIL
      features. DESIGN: We compiled performance data from the College of
      American Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Cervicovaginal
      Cytopathology from the years 2003 and 2004, and compared the performance
      of slides showing relatively pure LSIL and HSIL (< or = 10%
      misclassification as HSIL and LSIL, respectively) with slides showing
      mixed LSIL or HSIL features (cases misclassified as LSIL or HSIL > 10% of
      the time). RESULTS: Interpretations from a total of 4508 cases (2452 HSIL
      and 2056 LSIL) were analyzed. Overall, the sensitivity of participants on
      slides with a reference diagnosis of HSIL was 97.3%, and of LSIL was
      95.9%. Performance trends for pure versus mixed cases varied by slide type
      and reference diagnosis. For conventional slides, participant sensitivity
      on pure HSIL cases was greatest (98.0%) and on pure LSIL cases was least
      (95.2%), while participant performance on cases with mixed features was
      intermediate (97.0% for mixed HSIL and 96.7% for mixed LSIL). In contrast,
      participant performance on ThinPrep slides showed the greatest sensitivity
      for mixed LSIL slides (97.9%), while performance on mixed HSIL slides
      showed the lowest sensitivity (95.7%); slides with pure features had
      intermediate sensitivity levels (96.3% for both HSIL and LSIL). Further
      evaluation demonstrated that conventional pure HSIL slides performed
      significantly better than mixed HSIL slides (P = .006), whereas mixed LSIL
      slides performed better than pure LSIL slides (P = .01). For ThinPrep
      slides, pure HSIL cases performed similarly to mixed HSIL cases (P = .43),
      while mixed LSIL cases performed better than pure LSIL cases (P = .04).
      CONCLUSION: Slides with mixed LSIL and HSIL features have measurably
      distinct performance characteristics in comparison to slides with pure
      LSIL or HSIL features. Participant performance on conventional mixed cases
      is distinctly different from performance on ThinPrep mixed cases.

TI  - Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in the treatment of renal
      pelvicalyceal stones in morbidly obese patients.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Management of urolithiasis in morbidly obese patients is
      usually associated with higher morbidity and mortality compared to
      non-obese patients. In morbidly obese patients, since the kidney and stone
      are at a considerable distance from the skin (compared to non-obese
      patients) difficulty may be found in positioning the patient so that the
      stone is situated at the focal point of the lithotripter. OBJECTIVE: To
      evaluate the outcomes and cost-efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave
      lithotripsy (ESWL) in the treatment of renal pelvicalyceal stones sized
      between 6 and 20 mm in morbidly obese patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Using various aids, such as mobile overtable module, extended shock
      pathway and abdominal compression 37 patients with body mass index more
      than 40 kg/m2 were treated using the Siemens Lithostar-plus third
      generation lithotripter. The size of renal pelvicalyceal stones was
      between 6 and 20 mm. Treatment costs for shock wave lithotripsy were
      calculated. RESULTS: The overall stone free rate at 3 months of 73% was
      achieved. The mean number of treatments per patient was 2.1. The
      post-lithotripsy secondary procedures rate was 5.4%. No complications,
      such as subcapsular haematoma or acute pyelonephritis were recorded. The
      most effective (87% success rate) and cost-efficient treatment was in the
      patients with pelvic stones. The treatment of the patients with low
      caliceal stones was effective in 60% only. The cost of the treatment of
      the patients with low calyceal stones was in 1.8 times higher than in the
      patients with pelvic stones. CONCLUSION: We conclude that ESWL with the
      Siemens Lithostar-plus is the most effective and cost-efficient in
      morbidly obese patients with pelvic stones sized between 6 and 20 mm. 87%
      success rate was achieved. The increased distance from the skin surface to
      the stone in those patients does not decrease the success rate provided
      the stone is positioned in the focal point or within 3 cm of it on the
      extended shock pathway. ESWL should not be considered as the first line of
      treatment in the morbidly obese patients with low caliceal stones where
      the stone was positioned more than 1 cm from the focal point on the
      extended shock pathway.

TI  - Effects of gender and phase of the menstrual cycle on the kinetics of
      ranitidine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 485-94
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine if differences exist in the
      pharmacokinetic parameters of oral ranitidine caused by gender and stage
      of the menstrual cycle. The study was performed in two steps, in the first
      a pharmacokinetic study was performed on 10 men (average age 35.5 yrs) and
      10 women (average age 34.7 yrs) during the follicular phase, and in the
      second the pharmacokinetic study was performed only on the same women in
      their luteal phase. Subjects received a tablet dose of 300 mg ranitidine,
      and blood samples were drawn at several times after its ingestion. Plasma
      ranitidine concentration was determined by high performance liquid
      chromatography. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of women and
      men revealed statistically significant differences both in distribution
      volume (Vd) with values of 2.0 and 6.3 l/kg, Area Under Curve (AUC) with
      values of 7312.15 and 11471.94 ng/ml/h, and clearance (CLt) with values of
      0.65 and 0.59 l/kg/h, respectively. Several pharmacokinetic parameters in
      women were different in the follicular compared to the luteal phase; for
      example, Vd was 2.0 and 5.6 l/kg, AUC was 7312.15 and 5195.83 ng/ml/h, and
      CLt was 0.65 and 0.97 l/kg/h, in the respective phases. Moreover, the
      maximum concentration (Cmax) was 1086 ng/ml in the follicular vs. 864
      ng/ml in the luteal phase. The first study detected differences between
      men and women in several pharmacokinetic parameters, mainly those
      indicative of drug availability, for example, Vd, AUC, and CLt. Comparison
      of data obtained in the follicular phase with those obtained in the luteal
      phase revealed differences in most pharmacokinetic parameters, which is
      seemingly indicative of the characteristic physiological changes
      associated with the luteal phase that largely affect the kinetics and
      availability of drugs such as ranitidine. Although it has been postulated
      that hormonal fluctuation within the menstrual cycle phase is the primary
      cause of documented gender differences in the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of drugs, further study of related factors is required to
      understand how gender and menstrual cycle rhythms affect the
      phannacokinetic process in their entirety.

TI  - Ataxin-10 interacts with O-GlcNAc transferase OGT in pancreatic beta
      cells.
PG  - 149-53
AB  - Several nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in metazoans are modified by
      O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). This modification is dynamic and
      reversible similar to phosphorylation and is catalyzed by the O-linked
      GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Hyperglycemia has been shown to increase
      O-GlcNAc levels in pancreatic beta cells, which appears to interfere with
      beta-cell function. To obtain a better understanding of the role of
      O-linked GlcNAc modification in beta cells, we have isolated OGT
      interacting proteins from a cDNA library made from the mouse insulinoma
      MIN6 cell line. We describe here the identification of Ataxin-10, encoded
      by the SCA10 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 10) gene as an OGT interacting
      protein. Mutations in the SCA10 gene cause progressive cerebellar ataxias
      and seizures. We demonstrate that SCA10 interacts with OGT in vivo and is
      modified by O-linked glycosylation in MIN6 cells, suggesting a novel role
      for the Ataxin-10 protein in pancreatic beta cells.

TI  - Autogenic training for tension type headaches: a systematic review of
      controlled trials.
PG  - 144-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine from the published evidence whether autogenic
      training as sole therapy is effective for prevention of tension-type
      headaches in adults. METHOD: Systematic review of controlled trials.
      Literature searches were performed in January 2005 in six major databases,
      specifically Medline, EMBASE, AMED, CENTRAL, PsychInfo and CINAHL and
      information was extracted and evaluated in a pre-defined manner. RESULTS:
      Seven controlled clinical trials were included in the review. The
      methodological quality of these studies was low. Patient samples were
      generally representative of the more severely affected cases. None of the
      studies show autogenic training to be convincingly superior to other
      interventions care. Some trials suggested that the effect of autogenic
      training is no different from hypnosis and inferior to biofeedback.
      CONCLUSION: There is no consistent evidence to suggest that autogenic
      training is superior to other interventions for prevention of tension
      headaches, or different from other forms of relaxation. Further studies
      should investigate the use of standard autogenic training in patients with
      moderate headache.

TI  - Mutagenic stress modulates the dynamics of CTG repeat instability
      associated with myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 6733-40
AB  - The molecular basis of the myotonic dystrophy type 1 is the expansion of a
      CTG repeat at the DMPK locus. The expanded disease-associated repeats are
      unstable in both somatic and germ lines, with a high tendency towards
      expansion. The rate of expansion is directly related to the size of the
      pathogenic allele, increasing the size heterogeneity with age. It has also
      been suggested that additional factors, including as yet unidentified
      environmental factors, might affect the instability of the expanded CTG
      repeats to account for the observed CTG size dynamics over time. To
      investigate the effect of environmental factors in the CTG repeat
      instability, three lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from two
      myotonic dystrophy patients and one healthy individual, and parallel
      cultures were concurrently expanded in the presence or absence of the
      mutagenic chemical mitomycin C for a total of 12 population doublings. The
      new alleles arising along the passages were analysed by radioactive small
      pool PCR and sequencing gels. An expansion bias of the stepwise mutation
      was observed in a (CTG)124 allele of a cell line harbouring two modal
      alleles of 28 and 124 CTG repeats. Interestingly, this expansion bias was
      clearly enhanced in the presence of mitomycin C. The effect of mitomycin C
      was also evident in the normal size alleles in two cell lines with alleles
      of 13/13 and 12/69 repeats, where treated cultures showed new longer
      alleles. In conclusion, our results indicate that mitomycin C modulates
      the dynamics of myotonic dystrophy-associated CTG repeats in LBCLs,
      enhancing the expansion bias of long-pathogenic repeats and promoting the
      expansion of normal length repeats.

TI  - Laparoscopic application of PGE2 to re-establish oviducal patency and
      fertility in infertile mares: a preliminary study.
PG  - 454-9
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Mares are occasionally encountered that
      consistently fail to conceive when inseminated, naturally or artificially,
      with fertile stallion semen in the absence of any identifiable pathology
      of either the structure or function of their reproductive tract.
      HYPOTHESIS: Temporary blockage of the oviducts by accumulations of
      naturally occurring oviducal masses may be preventing oviducal transport
      of the embryo to the uterus. METHODS: Mares, with known reproductive
      histories, that had exhibited inexplicable failure of conception were
      treated by laparoscopically guided administration of PGE2-laced triacetin
      gel directly onto the surface of their oviducts. RESULTS: Fifteen mares
      age 10-21 years that had exhibited inexplicable failure of conception
      during 1-4 years were treated, of which 14 (93%) conceived within the same
      or subsequent breeding season. CONCLUSIONS: The high success rate of this
      treatment supports the tentative diagnosis of oviducal obstruction in
      these mares and indicates that blockage of the mare's oviducts may occur
      in the form of a moveable accumulation of debris rather than from
      permanent fibrous adhesions resulting from salpingitis. POTENTIAL
      RELEVANCE: This laparoscopic application of PGE2 to the oviducts
      constitutes a sound and practical method of restoring fertility in mares
      suffering oviducal obstruction and further studies involving the procedure
      are warranted.

TI  - High-resolution diffusion tensor imaging of human patellar cartilage:
      feasibility and preliminary findings.
PG  - 993-8
AB  - MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to analyze the microstructural
      properties of articular cartilage. Human patellar cartilage-on-bone
      samples were imaged at 9.4T using a diffusion-weighted SE sequence (12
      gradient directions, resolution = 39 x 78 x 1500 microm(3)). Voxel-based
      maps of the mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy (FA), and eigenvectors
      were calculated. The mean diffusivity decreased from the surface (1.45 x
      10(-3) mm(2)/s) to the tide mark (0.68 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). The FA was low
      (0.04-0.28) and had local maxima near the surface and in the portion of
      the cartilage corresponding to the radial layer. The eigenvector
      corresponding to the largest eigenvalue showed a distinct zonal pattern,
      being oriented tangentially and radially in the upper and lower portions
      of the cartilage, respectively. The findings correspond to current
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data on the zonal architecture of
      cartilage. The eigenvector maps appear to reflect the alignment of the
      collagenous fibers in cartilage. In view of current efforts to develop and
      evaluate structure-modifying therapeutic approaches in osteoarthritis
      (OA), DTI may offer a tool to assess the structural properties of
      cartilage.

TI  - Peritoneal lavage with oxygenated perfluorochemical improves hemodynamics,
      intestinal injury, and survival in a rat model of severe hemorrhagic shock
      and resuscitation.
PG  - 171-6
AB  - Perfluorochemicals (PFC) are chemical substances that have a high
      solubility for oxygen. This study investigated the effect of peritoneal
      lavage with oxygenated PFC (O2-PFC) against hemorrhagic shock and
      resuscitation (HS/R). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and bled
      to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 30 to 35 mmHg for 120 min. The
      animals then were resuscitated over 20 min with an infusion of shed blood.
      Peritoneal lavage was performed by inflow and outflow of the PFC solution
      at 80 mL/h during the shock-resuscitation period. Rats were divided into
      four groups. Group I, HS without peritoneal lavage; Group II, HS with
      nitrogenated PFC (N2-PFC) lavage; Group III, HS with O2-PFC lavage; and
      Group IV, sham-operated rats. Seven of seven (100%) rats in Group IV and
      six of seven (85.7%) rats in Group III survived for 48 h, and one of seven
      (14.3%) rats in Group I and zero of seven rats in Group II survived (P <
      0.01). In Group III rats, metabolic acidosis (assessed by blood gas
      analysis) and depression of intestinal blood flow (assessed by laser
      Doppler flowmetry) during HS were markedly ameliorated in comparison with
      those in Group I or Group II rats. The elevation of plasma TNF-alpha and
      IL-6 after HS/R were also attenuated in Group III. Histological study
      showed that O2-PFC lavage significantly decreased the degree of intestinal
      mucosal damage. We conclude that treatment with O2-PFC lavage ameliorated
      HS/R-induced metabolic acidosis and intestinal damage, which was
      associated with better mortality, possibly by preserving microvascular
      perfusion and maintaining oxygen metabolism.

TI  - Quantitative EEG analysis of REM sleep in children with Down syndrome.
PG  - 20-2
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim was to compare quantitative EEG analysis of REM sleep in
      children with Down syndrome (DS) and normal age-matched controls. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: Twenty-one channel EEG of 21 patients with Down syndrome and
      21 normal children, with ages ranging from 1 to 8 years, were submitted to
      quantitative analysis EEG of discharge-free epochs. The signals were
      recorded using a set of 17 (F3, F4, F7, F8, Fz, C3, C4, Cz, P3, P4, Pz,
      O1, O2, T3, T4, T5, T6) scalp electrodes. For each child, 20 artifact-free
      EEG epochs, each of 2 s without epileptiform discharges were selected for
      spectral analysis to calculate spectral power. Delta, theta, alpha and
      beta frequency ranges were compared between groups for all electrode
      positions. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis of the REM sleep from DS group
      disclosed reduction of the power mainly in the alpha when comparing the
      healthy group. Beta, theta and delta bands did not differ significantly
      between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings agree with recent evidences
      that these children may differ from children normal development.

TI  - Can transthoracic echocardiography with subcostal view predict abdominal
      aortic atherosclerosis?
PG  - 736-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prompt detection of atherosclerosis (ATH) may profoundly
      impact therapy and patient outcome. During transthoracic echocardiography
      (TTE), subcostal views may suggest abdominal (ABD) aortic (AO) ATH, but
      this diagnosis may be inaccurate due to suboptimal images, which may in
      part relate to use of nonlinear probes. Therefore, we investigated the
      accuracy of TTE assessment of ABD AO ATH relative to transesophageal (TEE)
      AO images. METHODS: Routine clinical TTE and TEE studies of 100 patients
      (44 men), aged 30-92 years old, were reviewed retrospectively and blindly.
      ABD AO ATH by TTE was graded qualitatively as grade (GR) 0 = smooth wall
      surface; GR 1, 2, and 3 = mild, moderate, and severe irregularities,
      respectively; and GR 4 = mobile/complex plaque. TEE images were graded
      quantitatively as the maximal intimal-medial, or plaque thickness, imaged
      in the AO arch or descending AO, as: GR 0 <or= 1.5 mm, GR 1 = 1.5-2.4 mm,
      GR 2 = 2.5-4 mm, GR 3 = >4 mm, or GR 4 = mobile/complex plaque >4 mm. TTE
      ability to detect the presence (>GR 0) of ABD AO ATH on TEE was measured
      in terms of sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive (PPV) and
      negative (NPV) predictive accuracy-in patients with adequate and
      suboptimal images-compared to TEE. RESULTS: TTE image quality was adequate
      in 75 patients and suboptimal in 25. SP and PPV of grading ATH by TTE were
      directly related to grading by TEE; however, SN and NPV demonstrated an
      inverse relationship with increasing grading of ATH. TTE correlated with
      TEE grading with an r = 0.42 (P = 0.0001) for patients (n = 75) with
      adequate TTE and r = 0.32 (P = 0.001) for all patients (n = 100),
      including those with suboptimal TTE images. CONCLUSION: Routine TTE
      imaging is usually correct in predicting ATH on TEE, but with modest
      error, it should generally not be relied on as a definitive test for ATH.
      Adequate image quality improves the correlation of TEE and TTE grading of
      ABD ATH, and more severe ATH on TTE is more predictive of ATH on TEE.

TI  - Response of mouse skin to tattooing: use of SKH-1 mice as a surrogate
      model for human tattooing.
PG  - 145-58
AB  - Tattooing is a popular cosmetic practice involving more than 45 million US
      citizens. Since the toxicology of tattoo inks and pigments used to
      formulate tattoo inks has not been reported, we studied the immunological
      impact of tattooing and determined recovery time from this trauma. SKH-1
      hairless mice were tattooed using commercial tattoo inks or suspensions of
      titanium dioxide, cadmium sulfide, or iron oxide, and sacrificed at 0.5,
      1, 3, 4, 7, or 14 days post-tattooing. Histological evaluation revealed
      dermal hemorrhage at 0.5 and 1 day. Acute inflammation and epidermal
      necrosis were initiated at 0.5 day decreasing in incidence by day 14.
      Dermal necrosis and epidermal hyperplasia were prominent by day 3,
      reducing in severity by day 14. Chronic active inflammation persisted in
      all tattooed mice from day 3 to 14 post-tattooing. Inguinal and axillary
      lymph nodes were pigmented, the inguinal being most reactive as evidenced
      by lymphoid hyperplasia and polymorphonuclear infiltration. Cutaneous
      nuclear protein concentrations of nuclear factor-kappa B were elevated
      between 0.5 and 4 days. Inflammatory and proliferative biomarkers,
      cyclooxygenase-1, cyclooxygenase-2, and ornithine decarboxylase protein
      levels were elevated between 0.5 and 4 days in the skin and decreased to
      control levels by day 14. Interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-10 were
      elevated in the lymph nodes but suppressed in the tattooed skin, with
      maximal suppression occurring between days 0.5 and 4. These data
      demonstrate that mice substantially recover from the tattooing insult by
      14 days, leaving behind pigment in the dermis and the regional lymph
      nodes. The response seen in mice is similar to acute injury seen in
      humans, suggesting that the murine model might be a suitable surrogate for
      investigating the toxicological and phototoxicological properties of
      ingredients used in tattooing.

TI  - Laser Doppler flowmetry is valid for measurement of cerebral blood flow
      autoregulation lower limit in rats.
PG  - 349-55
AB  - Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is a recent technique that is increasingly
      being used to monitor relative changes in cerebral blood flow whereas the
      intra-arterial 133xenon injection technique is a well-established method
      for repeated absolute measurements of cerebral blood flow. The aim of this
      study was to validate LDF for assessment of cerebral autoregulation and
      CO2 reactivity with the 133xenon injection technique as the gold standard.
      Simultaneous measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) were collected by
      LDF (CBF(LDF)) and the 133xenon method (CBF(Xe)) while (1) cerebral
      autoregulation was challenged by controlled systemic haemorrhage, or (2)
      cerebral blood flow was varied by manipulating the arterial partial
      pressure of CO2 (P(a,CO2)). LDF slightly overestimated CBF under
      conditions of haemorrhagic shock and haemodilution caused by controlled
      haemorrhage (paired t test, P < 0.05). However for pooled data, the
      autoregulation lower limit was similar when determined with the 133xenon
      and the LDF techniques: 65 +/- 3.9 mmHg and 60 +/- 5.6 mmHg, respectively.
      Linear regression analysis yielded CBF(Xe) = (1.02 x CBF(LDF)) + 9.1 and r
      = 0.90. Even for substantial changes in P(a,CO2), the two methods resulted
      in similar results. We conclude that even though LDF overestimated CBF
      during haemorrhagic shock caused by controlled haemorrhage, the lower
      limit autoregulation was correctly identified. The laser Doppler technique
      provides a reliable method for detection of a wide range of cerebral blood
      flow changes under CO2 challenge. Haemodilution influences the two methods
      differently causing relative overestimation of blood flow by the laser
      Doppler technique compared to the 1(33)xenon method.

TI  - [Cryotherapy III, Bibliographic review. Our experience (I)].
PG  - 873-97
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To perform a bibliographic review of the main features of
      cryotherapy as a therapeutic option in the managemente of prostate cancer
      and to report our initial experience. METHODS: We employed the Endocare
      Fast-Trac system (Medipro) with 2,4 mm needles implanted in a single
      maneouvre without rack or transrectal US transducer support. Two cycles of
      freezing--hawing were employed, with apex backward movement when
      necessary. Freezing cycle duration was between 7-10 minutes or more. The
      Onik maneouvre-injection of saline into the Denonvillier's
      space--diminishes the risk of rectal injury and fistula allowing reaching
      posterior limits of the ica-ball beyond the prostatic capsule. RESULTS: We
      treated 20 patients. Follow-up was between 30-36 months. 58% of the
      patients had unilateral prostate cancer, 42% bilateral. In accordance to
      the classic definition 9 patients were classified as low risk of
      extraprostatic disease, 6 medium risk and 5 high risk; using number of
      positive cores as the criterion for risk 5, 6 and 9 were low, medium and
      high risk respectively. Per protocol prostate biopsies were performed in
      18 patients 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment. Two patients underwent a
      second treatment due to persistence of cancer cells in the 6-month biopsy
      (11%). 3-month PSA nadirs after a total of 21 cryo treatments administered
      were < 0,2 ng/cc in 15 cases (78,9%), < 0,5 ng/cc in 17 (89,4%) and < or =
      1.0 ng/cc in 18 (94,7%); it was over 1 ng/cc in only 5,6%. 30 month PSA
      for the same cutoff values was 27.8%, 50.0%, 66.6% and 33.3%,
      respectively. Prostate cancer cells were detected in the 12-month biopsies
      of 5.5% cases. All 24-month biopsies were negative. COMPLICATIONS: We
      observed scrotal edema, hematoma, perineal pain and constipation which
      lasted 2-3 weeks. 1 patient suffered injury of the mucosa at the prostatic
      urethra, which did not result in rectal fistula and was treated with
      bladder catheter for 3 months. 4 patients had erectile dysfunction before
      treatment. All others presented erectile dysfunction after treatment; 3 of
      them (20%) recovered rigidity enough to have intercourse over the 30 month
      period. No urethral sloughing or acute urinary retention appeared and all
      patients are continent. CONCLUSIONS: Prostatic cryosurgery is an
      effective, minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of prostate
      cancer with very low surgical risk, low morbidity and almost null
      mortality.

TI  - Early event-related potential changes during working memory activation
      predict rapid decline in mild cognitive impairment.
PG  - 660-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to
      Alzheimer's disease is associated with substantial compromise of
      neocortical circuits subserving rapid cognitive functions such as working
      memory. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis is a powerful tool to
      identify early impairment of these circuits, yet research for an
      electrophysiological marker of cognitive deterioration in MCI is scarce.
      Using a "2-back" activation paradigm, we recently described an
      electrophysiological correlate of working memory activation
      (positive-negative working memory [PN(wm)] component) over parietal
      electrodes. METHODS: Ours was a longitudinal study of 24 MCI patients with
      ERP analysis at inclusion and neuropsychological follow-up after 1 year.
      We used ERP waveform subtraction analysis between the n-back and control
      tasks. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare
      electroencephalograph latencies between progressive MCI (PMCI) and stable
      MCI (SMCI), and univariate regression was used to assess the relationship
      between neuropsychological measures at baseline and clinical outcome.
      RESULTS: Thirteen (54%) MCI patients showed PMCI, and 11 (46%) remained
      stable (SMCI). In SMCI, a PN(wm) component with significantly larger
      density compared to baseline was identified when subtracting the detection
      task for both the 1- and 2-back tasks. In contrast, in PMCI, the PN(wm)
      component was absent in both 1-back and 2-back conditions.
      Neuropsychological variables and n-back test performance at inclusion did
      not predict cognitive deterioration 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: In
      conjunction with recent functional imaging data, the present results
      support the notion of an early dysfunction of neural generators within the
      parietal cortex in MCI. They also reveal that the absence of the PN(wm)
      component may provide an easily applicable qualitative predictive marker
      of rapid cognitive deterioration in MCI.

TI  - 25-Gauge transconjunctival sutureless pars plana vitrectomy.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and safety of the
      transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy (TSV) system for a vriety of
      vitreoretinal diseases. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the authors
      evaluated 71 eyes of 63 patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV)
      with the 25-gauge TSV system. The indications for surgical intervention
      were diabetic vitreous hemorrhage (29 eyes), diabetic macular edema (14
      eyes), macular epiretinal membrane (13 eyes), endophthalmitis (5 eyes),
      vitreous opacities secondary to Behcet's disease (4 eyes), vitreous
      hemorrhage secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (4 eyes), and
      vitreous hemorrhage secondary to age-related macular degeneration (2
      eyes). Epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane removal,
      endolaser photocoagulation, and air-fluid exchange were performed when
      required. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 3.6 months (range 1-8 months). Mean
      overall visual acuity (VA) was counting fingers (range light perception to
      0.4) preoperatively and 0.2 (range 0.1 to 0.8) postoperatively (p=0.000).
      Statistically significant VA improvement was observed in eyes with
      vitreous hemorrhage, diabetic macular edema, and macular epiretinal
      membrane. VA improved postoperatively in all eyes with endophthalmitis and
      vitreous opacities secondary to Behcet's disease. The surgery was
      completed without conjunctival and scleral suturing in all eyes. Mean
      intraocular pressure (IOP) was 17.2 mmHg (range 10-26 mmHg)
      preoperatively, 12.4 mmHg (range 6-24 mmHg) on the first postoperative
      day, 16.6 mmHg (range 10-33 mmHg) at 1 week, and 15.4 mmHg (range 10-20
      mmHg) at 1 month postoperatively. On the first postoperative day, IOP was
      below 10 mmHg (between 6 and 9 mmHg) in 12 eyes (16.9%). In these eyes,
      IOP was normalized within 1 week without affecting the visual outcome.
      Five eyes (7%) had transient increase of IOP controlled by topical
      antiglaucomatous medications. Vitreous washout using 25-gauge TSV system
      was performed in two eyes, in which vitreous hemorrhage recurred.
      CONCLUSIONS: The TSV system was observed to be feasible, effective, and
      safe for a variety of vitre o retinal diseases. This minimally invasive
      and completely sutureless (transconjunctival) technique appears to
      decrease the convalescence period, operating time, and postoperative
      inflammatory response, and improve patient comfort.

TI  - A case exercise: outbreak investigation at a Vermont community hospital.
PG  - 301-5
AB  - Fifteen employees became ill with headaches, nausea, and vomiting due to
      chemical poisoning at a Vermont community hospital on January 3, 1980. An
      epidemiologic and environmental investigation was conducted to determine
      the source of the illness. The investigation discovered that the vapors of
      a chemical called xylene, which had previously been disposed of down a
      drain, were drawn back through the sewer into specific work areas. These
      vapors were determined to be the most likely cause of the illnesses. This
      outbreak investigation was used to create an exercise that has been used
      in a variety of teaching settings.

TI  - Occupational goals of mothers of children with disabilities: influence of
      temporal, social, and emotional contexts.
PG  - 249-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the occupational
      concerns and goals of mothers who care for children with disabilities.
      METHOD: Retrospective data collected from 38 mothers of children with
      disabilities using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)
      were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: Six themes emerged: (I) doing and
      being alone: taking care of my own health and well-being; (II) doing and
      being with others: expanding my social life; (III) improving my child's
      quality of life; (IV) household management: organizing time and resources;
      (V) balancing work, home, and community responsibilities; and (VI) sharing
      the workload. CONCLUSION: Overarching patterns in the data suggested that
      the occupational performance of mothers of children with disabilities is
      constrained by time, overlaid by difficult emotions, and involves a desire
      for increased social contact. Qualitative analysis of data from the COPM
      may provide insight into contextual factors that affect occupational
      performance as well as signaling point of entry for therapists to
      facilitate client-centered occupational goals.

      collagen-induced arthritis.
PG  - 5373-6
AB  - AIM: To explore the effect of Gui Zhi decoction on enteric mucosal immune
      in type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA mice. METHODS: Eighty
      DBA/1, weighing 18-22 g, were randomly divided into four groups with 20 in
      each group: control group, CIA group, treatment groups at high dosage and
      low dosage (GZH and GZL). CIA was induced by immunization with type II
      collagen (CII) emulsified with equal complete adjuvant at 0.1 mg CII each
      mouse. Blood lymphocyte suspension was screened for CD4 and CD8 expression
      using a flow cytometry, the CD4 and CD8 and secretory IgA (sIgA)-positive
      cells in enteric lamina propria tested with immunohistochemical staining.
      Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1)-beta, and
      IL-6 concentrations in serum were assayed with RIA. RESULTS: Gui Zhi
      decoction can lower the arthritic scores and decrease the occurrence of
      arthritis. The CD4, CD8, and sIgA-positive cells in CIA mice are less than
      in control mice, and in Gui Zhi decoction at high dosage could restore the
      lowered CD4- and CD8-positive cells in lamina propria, and at both high
      and low dosages could increase the lowered sIgA-positive cells in lamina
      propria, even still lower than in normal mice. In periphery, the CD4 cells
      in periphery are higher in CIA mice than in control mice, and Gui Zhi
      decoction at high and low dosages could decrease the CD4 and CD8 cells.
      Also, Gui Zhi decoction at high dosage could decrease the IL-6 and
      TNF-alpha concentration in serum. CONCLUSION: Gui Zhi decoction can lower
      the arthritic scores and decrease the incidence of CIA in mice, and the
      mechanism is in part regulating enteric mucosal immune.

TI  - The DYRK1A gene, encoded in chromosome 21 Down syndrome critical region,
      bridges between beta-amyloid production and tau phosphorylation in
      Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 15-23
AB  - We scanned throughout chromosome 21 to assess genetic associations with
      late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) using 374 Japanese patients and 375
      population-based controls, because trisomy 21 is known to be associated
      with early deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain. Among 417
      markers spanning 33 Mb, 22 markers showed associations with either the
      allele or the genotype frequency (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis
      with age, sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 dose supported genetic
      risk of 17 markers, of which eight markers were linked to the SAMSN1,
      PRSS7, NCAM2, RUNX1, DYRK1A and KCNJ6 genes. In logistic regression, the
      DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A) gene, located in
      the Down syndrome critical region, showed the highest significance [OR =
      2.99 (95% CI: 1.72-5.19), P = 0.001], whereas the RUNX1 gene showed a high
      odds ratio [OR = 23.3 (95% CI: 2.76-196.5), P = 0.038]. DYRK1A mRNA level
      in the hippocampus was significantly elevated in patients with AD when
      compared with pathological controls (P < 0.01). DYRK1A mRNA level was
      upregulated along with an increase in the Abeta-level in the brain of
      transgenic mice, overproducing Abeta at 9 months of age. In neuroblastoma
      cells, Abeta induced an increase in the DYRK1A transcript, which also led
      to tau phosphorylation at Thr212 under the overexpression of tau.
      Therefore, the upregulation of DYRK1A transcription results from Abeta
      loading, further leading to tau phosphorylation. Our result indicates that
      DYRK1A could be a key molecule bridging between beta-amyloid production
      and tau phosphorylation in AD.

TI  - Neonatal Dubin-Johnson syndrome: long-term follow-up and MRP2 mutations
      study.
PG  - 584-9
AB  - Neonatal Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS) is rarely diagnosed and mutational
      analysis of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) in such
      patients had not been reported. We aimed to investigate the possible
      correlations between genotype and phenotype of patients with DJS. Four
      cases of DJS, two diagnosed during the neonatal period and two diagnosed
      at adolescence, were followed for 5-20 y. Mutational analysis in the
      MRP2/ABCC2 gene was performed in all four cases. Biphasic pattern of
      jaundice attack was observed in one patient who was followed for 20 y,
      with jaundice subsiding before 1 y of age and recurring at adolescence.
      Six novel mutations in four patients were found, including deletions
      (2748del136, 3615del229, and Del3399-3400), and missense mutations (L441M
      and E1352Q) and nonsense mutation (Y1275X). The immunohistochemical
      staining in liver tissues from two patients with neonatal onset showed
      negative staining for MRP2. Reviewing previously reported cases, all
      patients diagnosed as DJS before 10 y of age have mutations involving one
      of the two ATP-binding cassettes (ABC) of the MRP2. This study suggests
      that long-term follow-up is indicated for neonatal DJS because of possible
      recurrence and/or second attacks of jaundice in later life, and that
      disruption of functionally important ABC domains in MRP2 may be related to
      the earlier onset of the disease.

TI  - Selection of optimal adjuvant endocrine therapy for early-stage breast
      cancer.
PG  - 153-65
AB  - Oophorectomy was found to cause regression of advanced breast cancer
      toward the end of the 19th century. Decades later, the discovery that
      estrogen plays a central role in this process eventually led to two
      important consequences: first, different modalities were developed to
      suppress or antagonize estrogen; and second, the ability to detect
      estrogen receptor in breast cancer tissue became a predictor of response
      to treatment--probably the best marker for response among all solid
      tumors. Tamoxifen, which works by competitively antagonizing hormonal
      receptors in breast cancer cells, has been for the past three decades the
      standard of care for adjuvant therapy for any woman with hormone
      receptor-positive early breast cancer, regardless of nodal status or
      menopausal setting. But as we strive to improve the utility of
      antagonizing or suppressing estrogen, new modalities are being developed.
      In the premenopausal setting, the advent of gonadotropin hormone-releasing
      hormone (also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) analogues
      has allowed for medical and reversible suppression of ovarian function.
      This method has already been proven as effective as chemotherapy in
      preventing recurrence, and ongoing trials are aiming to better define its
      role in the adjuvant setting. In the postmenopausal setting, aromatase
      inhibitors (AIs) have revolutionized the adjuvant treatment of
      hormone-responsive cancers of all stages. The current standard of care has
      come to include AIs, as an alternative, in sequence, of after 5 years of
      tamoxifen. Ongoing research continues to develop agents to overcome
      hormonal therapy resistance.

TI  - Evidence of association of macrophage migration inhibitory factor gene
      polymorphisms with systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 433-6
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential association of
      functional polymorphisms of macrophage migration inhibitory factor with
      systemic lupus erythematosus. Our study includes 711 systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) patients and 755 healthy controls. We genotyped the
      migration inhibitory factor (MIF) -173G/C using a polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) system with predeveloped TaqMan allelic discrimination
      assay and the MIF -794 CATT(n) microsatellite polymorphism using a
      PCR-fluorescent method. A statistically significant difference in the
      distribution of the MIF -173(*)C allele between SLE patients and controls
      (P=0.004, OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.05-1.27) was observed. In addition, the
      frequency of the MIF -173(*)C/C genotype was higher in SLE patient
      (P=0.002, OR=2.58, 95% CI=1.32-5.10). No differences in the distribution
      of CATT(n) were found. However, the haplotypes analyses showed that only
      the CATT(7)-MIF -173(*)C haplotype was associated with a higher
      susceptibility to SLE (P=0.001, OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35-2.79). No association
      with clinical features was detected in any case. These results suggest
      that both, MIF -173(*)C allele and CATT(7)-MIF -173(*)C haplotype, confer
      susceptibility to SLE in our population.

TI  - Influence of different tests used to measure the bond strength to dentin
      of two adhesive systems.
PG  - 37-40
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the behavior of two bonding systems: self-etching
      primer Clearfil Liner Bond 2V (CLB) and total-etch Single Bond (SB) when
      submitted to two bond strength tests: shear bond strength (SBS) and
      microtensile (MTBS). METHODS: Flat dentin surfaces were obtained at the
      facial surface of extracted bovine incisors. muTBS started with adhesive
      application and incremental resin composite insertion. Samples were then
      sliced into 1 mm slabs parallel to the long axis of the tooth. Half of the
      specimens from each group were trimmed in order to obtain dumbbell-shaped
      (D) specimens with a cross-sectional area of 1 mm2, and in the other half
      of the group, the slabs were cut into beams (B) with a cross section of 1
      mm2 area. Specimens were individually fractured on a microtensile
      apparatus. For SBS, crown segments were embedded in polyester resin and a
      flat dentin surface was exposed for bonding. After adhesive and
      restorative procedures were accomplished, the specimens were kept in water
      for 24 hours prior to bond testing. The tests were performed in a
      universal testing machine. MPa values were analyzed by Tukey's test (P <
      0.05), two-way ANOVA (muTBS) and Student's t-test (SBS). RESULTS: Mean
      values (SD) on muTBS were: SB/B: 42.6 (15.1), SB/D: 35.4 (6.8), CLB/B:
      14.3 (10.3) and CLB/D: 27.0 (7.9). SBS values (SD) were: SB: 17.3 (5.6)
      and CLB 15.9 (7.2). Beam specimens bonded with CLB presented the lowest
      results. SBS did not show statistical differences between groups. The
      results showed that the shear bond test seemed to lack the sensitivity
      that is required to detect subtle differences between bonding agents or
      procedures.

TI  - Persistence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and other
      zoonotic pathogens during simulated composting, manure packing, and liquid
      storage of dairy manure.
PG  - 565-74
AB  - Livestock manures contain numerous microorganisms which can infect humans
      and/or animals, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes,
      Salmonella spp., and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis
      (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis). The effects of commonly used manure
      treatments on the persistence of these pathogens have rarely been
      compared. The objective of this study was to compare the persistence of
      artificially inoculated M. paratuberculosis, as well as other naturally
      occurring pathogens, during the treatment of dairy manure under conditions
      that simulate three commonly used manure management methods: thermophilic
      composting at 55 degrees C, manure packing at 25 degrees C (or
      low-temperature composting), and liquid lagoon storage. Straw and sawdust
      amendments used for composting and packing were also compared. Manure was
      obtained from a large Ohio free-stall dairy herd and was inoculated with
      M. paratuberculosis at 10(6) CFU/g in the final mixes. For compost and
      pack treatments, this manure was amended with sawdust or straw to provide
      an optimal moisture content (60%) for composting for 56 days. To simulate
      liquid storage, water was added to the manure (to simulate liquid flushing
      and storage) and the slurry was placed in triplicate covered 4-liter
      Erlenmeyer flasks, incubated under ambient conditions for 175 days. The
      treatments were sampled on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 for the detection
      of pathogens. The persistence of M. paratuberculosis was also assessed by
      a PCR hybridization assay. After 56 days of composting, from 45 to 60% of
      the carbon in the compost treatments was converted to CO2, while no
      significant change in carbon content was observed in the liquid slurry.
      Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Listeria were all detected in the manure
      and all of the treatments on day 0. After 3 days of composting at 55
      degrees C, none of these organisms were detectable. In liquid manure and
      pack treatments, some of these microorganisms were detectable up to 28
      days. M. paratuberculosis was detected by standard culture only on day 0
      in all the treatments, but was undetectable in any treatment at 3 and 7
      days. On days 14, 28, and 56, M. paratuberculosis was detected in the
      liquid storage treatment but remained undetectable in the compost and pack
      treatments. However, M. paratuberculosis DNA was detectable through day 56
      in all treatments and up to day 175 in liquid storage treatments. Taken
      together, the results indicate that high-temperature composting is more
      effective than pack storage or liquid storage of manure in reducing these
      pathogens in dairy manure. Therefore, thermophilic composting is
      recommended for treatment of manures destined for pathogen-sensitive
      environments such as those for vegetable production, residential
      gardening, or application to rapidly draining fields.

TI  - Addressing the cancer control needs of Pacific Islanders: experience of
      the Pacific Islander Cancer Control Network.
PG  - 233-8
AB  - PURPOSE: This paper describes the accomplishments of the Pacific Islander
      Cancer Control Network (PICCN). PICCN's objectives fall under two broad
      categories: increasing cancer awareness and enhancing cancer control
      research among Samoans, Tongans, and Chamorros. METHODS: PICCN established
      an infrastructure for addressing the goals that include the University of
      California, Irvine; the UCI Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; and
      community-based organizations (CBOs) in areas where large numbers of
      Pacific Islanders live. Activities that increase cancer awareness include
      assessing existing cancer education materials, developing new
      culturally-sensitive materials, and distributing the materials in a
      culturally-sensitive manner. Activities that enhance cancer control
      research include training Pacific Islander investigators and providing
      them with mentors to help with the development of research projects.
      RESULTS: During the four project years, PICCN has conducted more than 180
      cancer awareness activities in its six study sites: Carson, CA; San Mateo,
      CA; San Diego, CA; Salt Lake City, UT; American Samoa; and Guam. PICCN
      members have also participated in conferences and lead discussions about
      the importance of clinical trials for Pacific Islanders. In addition, the
      Network has trained nine Pacific Islander investigators (three individuals
      from each ethnic group) in its cancer control academy. Finally, PICCN
      investigators are conducting pilot research projects that will answer
      important questions regarding the cancer control needs of these Pacific
      Islanders and set the stage for interventions aimed at addressing the
      needs. CONCLUSION: PICCN is advancing the national goal of eliminating
      cancer-related health disparities through its cancer awareness and
      research activities for Pacific Islanders.

TI  - An introduction to the basic principles of health economics for those
      involved in the development and delivery of headache care.
PG  - 709-14
AB  - Against a background of increasing demands on limited resources, health
      economics is gaining an increasing impact on decision making and a basic
      understanding of the subject is important for all those involved in
      headache research and service delivery at whatever level. This paper is
      not intended as a review of the literature in the area of headache
      economics but discusses some general principles of health economics from
      the perspective of headache, with a focus on cost of illness studies and
      economic evaluation.

TI  - MKP1/CL100 controls tumor growth and sensitivity to cisplatin in
      non-small-cell lung cancer.
PG  - 3335-45
AB  - Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the most frequent and
      therapy-refractive sub-class of lung cancer. Improving apoptosis induction
      in NSCLC represents a logical way forward in treating this tumor.
      Cisplatin, a commonly used therapeutic agent in NSCLC, induces activation
      of N-terminal-c-Jun kinase (JNK) that, in turn, mediates induction of
      apoptosis. In analysing surgical tissue samples of NSCLC, we found that
      expression of MKP1/CL100, a negative regulator of JNK, showed a strong
      nuclear staining for tumor cells, whereas, in normal bronchial epithelia,
      MKP1 was localized in the cytoplasm as well as in nuclei. In the
      NSCLC-derived cell lines H-460 and H-23, we found that MKP1 was
      constitutively expressed. Expressing a small-interfering RNA (siRNA)
      vector for MKP1 in H-460 cells resulted in a more efficient activation by
      cisplatin of JNK and p38 than in the parental cells, and this correlated
      with a 10-fold increase in sensitivity to cisplatin. A similar response
      was also observed in H-460 and H-23 cells when treated with the MKP1
      expression inhibitor RO-31-8220. Moreover, expression of a siRNA-MKP2, an
      MKP1-related phosphatase, had no effect on H-460 cell viability response
      to cisplatin. Tumors induced by H-460 cells expressing MKP1 siRNA grew
      slower in nu(-)/nu(-) mice and showed more susceptibility to cisplatin
      than parental cells, and resulted in an impaired growth of the tumor in
      mice. On the other hand, overexpression of MKP1 in the H-1299
      NSCLC-derived cell line resulted in further resistance to cisplatin.
      Overall, the results showed that inhibition of MKP1 expression contributes
      to a slow down in cell growth in mice and an increase of cisplatin-induced
      cell death in NSCLC. As such, MKP1 can be an attractive target in
      sensitizing cells to cisplatin to increase the effectiveness of the drug
      in treating NSCLC.

TI  - Efficient information theoretic strategies for classifier combination,
      feature extraction and performance evaluation in improving false positives
      and false negatives for spam e-mail filtering.
PG  - 799-807
AB  - Spam emails are considered as a serious privacy-related violation, besides
      being a costly, unsolicited communication. Various spam filtering
      techniques have been so far proposed, mainly based on Naive Bayesian
      algorithms. Other Machine Learning algorithms like Boosting trees, or
      Support Vector Machines (SVM) have already been used with success.
      However, the number of False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN)
      resulting through applying various spam e-mail filters still remains too
      high and the problem of spam e-mail categorization cannot be solved
      completely from a practical viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a novel
      approach for spam e-mail filtering based on efficient information
      theoretic techniques for integrating classifiers, for extracting improved
      features and for properly evaluating categorization accuracy in terms of
      FP and FN. The goal of the presented methodology is to empirically but
      explicitly minimize these FP and FN numbers by combining high-performance
      FP filters with high-performance FN filters emerging from a previous work
      of the authors [Zorkadis, V., Panayotou, M., & Karras, D. A. (2005).
      Improved spam e-mail filtering based on committee machines and information
      theoretic feature extraction. Proceedings of the International Joint
      Conference on Neural Networks, July 31-August 4, 2005, Montreal, Canada].
      To this end, Random Committee-based filters along with ADTree-based ones
      are efficiently combined through information theory, respectively. The
      experiments conducted are of the most extensive ones so far in the
      literature, exploiting widely accepted benchmarking e-mail data sets and
      comparing the proposed methodology with the Naive Bayes spam filter as
      well as with the Boosting tree methodology, the classification via
      regression and other machine learning models. It is illustrated by means
      of novel information theoretic measures of FP & FN filtering performance
      that the proposed approach is very favorably compared to the other rival
      methods. Finally, it is found that the proposed information theoretic
      Boolean features present a remarkably high spam categorization
      performance.

TI  - Underrepresentation of short palindromes in Selenomonas ruminantium DNA:
      evidence for horizontal gene transfer of restriction and modification
      systems?
PG  - 315-8
AB  - Molecular analysis of isolates of the rumen bacterium Selenomonas
      ruminantium revealed a high variety and frequency of site-specific
      (restriction) endonucleases. While all known S. ruminantium restriction
      and modification systems recognize hexanucleotide sequences only,
      consistently low counts of both 6-bp and 4-bp palindromes were found in
      DNA sequences of S. ruminantium. Statistical analysis indicated that there
      is some correlation between the degree of underrepresentation of
      tetranucleotide words and the number of known restriction endonucleases
      for a given sequence. Control analysis showed the same correlation in
      lambda DNA but not in human adenovirus DNA. Based on the data presented,
      it could be proposed that there is a much higher historical occurrence of
      restriction and modification systems in S. ruminantium and (or) frequent
      horizontal gene transfer of restriction and modification gene complexes.

TI  - Mutations in the thyrotropin receptor signal transduction pathway in the
      hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules from multinodular goiters: a study in the
      Turkish population.
PG  - 577-85
AB  - Many studies have been carried out to determine G(s) alpha and TSHR
      mutations in autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Variable
      prevalences for somatic constitutively activating TSHR mutations in hot
      nodules have been reported. Moreover, the increased prevalence of toxic
      multinodular goiters in iodine-deficient regions is well known. In Turkey,
      a country with high incidence rates of goiter due to iodine deficiency,
      the frequency of mutations in the thyrotropin receptor signal transduction
      pathway has not been evaluated up to now. In the present study, a part of
      the genes of the TSHR, G(s)alpha and the catalytic subunit of the PKA were
      checked for activating mutations. Thirty-five patients who underwent
      thyroidectomy for multinodular goiters were examined. Genomic DNAs were
      extracted from 58 hyperactive nodular specimens and surrounding normal
      thyroid tissues. Mutation screening was done by single-strand
      conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. In those cases where a
      mutation was detected, the localization of the mutation was determined by
      automatic DNA sequencing. No G(s)alpha or PKA mutations were detected,
      whereas ten mutations (17%) were identified in the TSHR gene. All
      mutations were somatic and heterozygotic. In conclusion, the frequency of
      mutations in the cAMP signal transduction pathway was found to be lower
      than expected in the Turkish population most likely because of the use of
      SSCP as a screening method and sequencing only a part of TSHR exon 10.

TI  - Endothelial cadherins and tumor angiogenesis.
PG  - 659-67
AB  - Adherens junctions and more specifically cadherins play an important role
      in endothelial cell integrity and growth and, in general, in vascular
      morphogenesis. Besides their adhesive properties, cadherins may act by
      transferring intracellular signals through interaction with a complex
      network of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules. Cadherins may signal in
      different ways: through direct activation of signaling pathways, through
      interaction with cell-specific growth factor receptors or by controlling
      beta-catenin and/or other transcription factors' translocation to the
      nucleus. Endothelial cells present different cadherins which may transfer
      specific signals and exert distinct functional roles. VE-cadherin is
      endothelial-specific and the major constituent of adherens junctions. This
      protein is able to protect endothelial cells from apoptosis and
      contributes to contact inhibition of endothelial cell growth. N-cadherin
      is also abundantly expressed in the endothelium and may be important in
      modulating VE-cadherin expression. T cadherin, R-cadherin and VE-cadherin
      2 were found in specific regions of the vascular tree but their role in
      vascular development or angiogenesis is still unclear.

TI  - Prevalence of HIV status and CD4 counts in a surgical cohort: their
      relationship to clinical outcome.
PG  - 46-51
AB  - INTRODUCTION: HIV positivity alone as a predictor of surgical outcome has
      not been extensively studied in regions of high prevalence. The aim was to
      determine the prevalence of HIV infection in surgical patients, and
      compare differences in their clinical course based on their serological
      status and CD4 counts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort of 350
      patients, enrolled over 6 weeks, were studied. HIV status was determined
      in all patients. HIV-positive patients had CD4 counts. Clinical details
      were collated with HIV data after completion of enrollment. RESULTS: Of
      the 350 patients, all but 6 were black South Africans. The median age was
      31 years (range, 18-82 years). There were 143 trauma and 207 non-trauma
      patients. The male:female ratio was 1.4:1. The overall HIV seropositivity
      rate was 39% (females, 46%; males, 36%). Overall, 228 patients had
      surgical intervention and 96 patients had drainage of sepsis. The hospital
      stay (HIV negative, 11.9 +/- 15.9 days; HIV positive, 11.0 +/- 15 days)
      and mortality (HIV positive, 3.6%; HIV negative, 3.7%) did not differ by
      major diagnostic category. For HIV-positive patients, the male:female
      ratio was 1.2:1. There were 54 trauma and 83 non-trauma patients. An
      operation for the drainage of a septic focus was commoner in the
      HIV-positive admissions. Thirty-two (24%) patients had CD4 counts less
      than 200 cells/mm3, (i.e. AIDS). The hospital mortality, hospital stay and
      severity of sepsis were not related to CD4 counts. CONCLUSIONS: HIV status
      does not influence the outcome of general surgical admissions and should
      not influence surgical management decisions. In HIV-positive surgical
      patients, CD4 counts have no relation to in-hospital outcome in a
      heterogeneous group of surgical patients.

TI  - Change in vascular adhesion protein-1 and metabolic phenotypes after
      vertical banded gastroplasty for morbid obesity.
PG  - 855-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The association between circulating vascular adhesion protein-1
      (VAP-1) and metabolic phenotypes has been shown to be inconsistent. The
      current study explored whether the changes in serum VAP-1 levels correlate
      with the changes in metabolic phenotypes after weight reduction surgery.
      RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Clinical characteristics and serum VAP-1
      levels in 20 morbidly obese subjects (mean BMI 38.84 kg/m(2)) were
      measured before and after vertical banded gastroplasty. RESULTS: Before
      surgery, serum VAP-1 levels correlated positively with fasting plasma
      glucose (gamma = 0.56, p = 0.01) and negatively with insulin levels (gamma
      = -0.51, p = 0.021). After surgery, the changes in serum VAP-1 levels were
      negatively correlated with the changes in waist circumference (gamma =
      -0.57, p = 0.011), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (gamma = -0.56, p =
      0.015), and mean arterial pressure (gamma = -0.46, p = 0.055). In
      multivariate regression, serum VAP-1 levels were negatively correlated
      with waist circumference (beta = -2.36, p = 0.014) and DBP (beta = -3.02,
      p = 0.017) after adjusting for age and gender. The change in DBP was
      negatively correlated with the change in VAP-1 levels after adjusting for
      age, gender, and steady-state plasma glucose. DISCUSSION: The results
      suggest that VAP-1 levels are correlated with fasting glucose and insulin
      levels in morbidly obese subjects. After surgery, the changes in VAP-1
      levels were associated with changes in visceral adiposity and DBP. Serum
      VAP-1 might modulate DBP independently from the changes in insulin
      resistance in morbidly obese people.

TI  - Targeting the active site of the placental isozyme of alkaline phosphatase
      by phage-displayed scFv antibodies selected by a specific uncompetitive
      inhibitor.
PG  - 33
AB  - BACKGROUND: The isozymes of alkaline phosphatase, the tissue non-specific,
      intestinal and placental, have similar properties and a high degree of
      identity. The placental isozyme (PLAP) is an oncofetal antigen expressed
      in several malignancies including choriocarcinoma, seminoma and ovarian
      carcinoma. We had earlier attempted to isolate PLAP-specific scFv from a
      synthetic human immunoglobulin library but were unable to do so,
      presumably because of the similarity between the isozymes. In this work,
      we have employed a PLAP-specific uncompetitive inhibitor, L-Phe-Gly-Gly,
      to select isozyme specific scFvs. An uncompetitive inhibitor binds to the
      enzyme in the presence of substrate and stabilizes the enzyme-substrate
      complex. Several uncompetitive inhibitors have varying degrees of isozyme
      specificity for human alkaline phosphatase isozymes. A specific
      uncompetitive inhibitor would be able to unmask conformational differences
      between the otherwise very similar molecules. Also, such inhibitors would
      be directed to regions at/close to the active site of the enzyme. In this
      work, the library was first incubated with PLAP and the bound clones then
      eluted by incubation with L-Phe-Gly-Gly along with the substrate,
      para-nitro phenyl phosphate (pNPP). The scFvs were then studied with
      regard to the biochemical modulation of their binding, isozyme specificity
      and effect on enzyme activity. RESULTS: Of 13 clones studied initially,
      the binding of 9 was inhibited by L-Phe-Gly-Gly (with pNPP) and 2 clones
      were inhibited by pNPP alone. Two clones had absolute and 2 clones had
      partial specificity to PLAP. Two clones were cross-reactive with only one
      other isozyme. Three scFv clones, having an accessible His6-tag, were
      purified and studied for their modulation of enzyme activity. All the
      three scFvs inhibited PLAP activity with the kinetics of competitive
      inhibition. Cell ELISA could demonstrate binding of the specific scFvs to
      the cell surface expressed PLAP. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the
      biochemical modulation of scFv binding. Also, the scFvs bound to the
      active site and denied the access to the substrate. The selection strategy
      could generate specific anti-enzyme antibodies to PLAP that can
      potentially be used for targeting, for modulating enzyme activity in in
      vitro and in vivo and as probes for the active site. This strategy also
      has a general application in selecting antibodies from combinatorial
      libraries to closely related molecules and conformations.

TI  - Storage of neutrophil granulocytes (PMNs) in additive solution or in
      autologous plasma for 72 h.
PG  - 223-31
AB  - Neutropenia may necessitate polymorphonuclear (PMN) transfusion, but among
      other reasons, PMN short shelf-life complicates realization of innovative
      transfusion strategies. In 18 donors, PMNs were mobilized using rHuG-CSF +
      dexamethasone. (8.3 +/- 1.6) x 10(10) PMNs were harvested in 203 +/- 8.7
      mL. PMNs were stored undiluted (1, n = 18) and diluted 1-in-2, 1-in-4,
      1-in-8 using T-Sol (2, n = 6), T-Sol + 1% HSA (3, n = 6), or autologous
      plasma (4, n = 6) for 72 h. Haemograms, pH values, phagocytosis, oxidative
      burst, and interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha levels were assessed every 24 h. PMN count decreased from (4.3
      +/- 0.8) x 10(10) to (2.2 +/- 1.0) x 10(10), and pH value dropped from 6.4
      +/- 0.3 to 5.4 +/- 0.2 within 72 h (1), whereas 1-in-4 and 1-in-8
      dilutions exhibited consistent haemograms and pH values above 6.0. 1-in-8
      dilution (4) stabilized pH at 7.1 +/- 0.4 after 72 h. Function
      deteriorated to about 50% within 24 h (1), but 1-in-8 (3), 1-in-4 and
      1-in-8 diluted PMNs (4) kept it >90% for 72 h. In all collectives,
      cytokine levels increased during storage. After all, IL-1beta ranged
      between 31.0 +/- 16.3 (1-in-4, 4) and 100.0 +/- 21.4 (1-in-4, 2), IL-8
      from 513 +/- 454 (1) to 3180 +/- 760 (1-in-8, 2), and TNF-alpha between
      3.8 +/- 1.7 (1-in-2, 2) and 23.2 +/- 11.8 (1-in-8, 4) (pg mL(-1)). PMN
      function may be preserved for 72 h in vitro by dilution of PMN apheresates
      with, preferably, autologous plasma.

TI  - Laparoscopic surgery for the management of obstruction of the gastric
      outlet and small bowel following previous laparotomy for major upper
      gastrointestinal resection or cancer palliation: a new concept.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical relief of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) or small
      bowel obstruction in patients who had undergone major resection or
      palliative bypass surgery for malignancy is conventionally achieved at a
      laparotomy. The potential role of minimally invasive surgery in the
      management of these complications has not been previously explored.
      METHODS: Between 2003 and 2004, 4 consecutive patients, age range 37 to 72
      years, where admitted with gastric outlet or proximal small bowel
      obstruction following previous open surgery for suspected intra-abdominal
      malignancy, under the care of one surgeon. The respective past histories
      of these patients were recurrent GOO and concomitant distal biliary
      obstruction following a previous open gastric bypass elsewhere for
      metastatic pancreatic head cancer; persistent adhesive small bowel
      obstruction following radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer; GOO
      secondary to intra-abdominal recurrence 6 months after hepatobiliary
      resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma; and GOO following previous
      pancreatico-duodenectomy for suspected pancreatic head cancer. Their
      respective surgical management consisted of a laparoscopic re-do gastric
      bypass and concomitant cholecystojejunostomy; adhesiolysis and revision of
      the Roux-en-Y enteric anastomosis; a Devine exclusion gastroenterostomy;
      and resection and refashioning of the gastroenterostomy. RESULTS: There
      were no conversions to open surgery and no postoperative complications.
      The median operating time was 240 minutes (range, 145 to 300 minutes).
      Oral free fluid intake was resumed on postoperative day (POD) 1, while
      diet was resumed between POD 2 and 4. The median postoperative hospital
      stay was 15.5 days (range, 14 to 25 days). CONCLUSION: Previous laparotomy
      and major resection or palliation of malignancy do not preclude the
      application of the laparoscopic approach for the management of upper
      gastrointestinal obstruction. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis and revision of
      enteroenteric and gastroenteric anastomoses are feasible management
      options in the hands of those experienced with complex laparoscopic
      surgery.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of synovial cells from the human
      temporomandibular joint.
PG  - 104-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: The synovial tissues with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)
      often show chronic inflammatory changes and the synovial cells participate
      in the pathogenic processes of TMDs. The synovial membrane is composed of
      a synovial lining layer and a connective sublining layer. The synovial
      lining layer is made up of two kinds of cells: macrophage-like type A and
      fibroblastic type B cells. The aim of this study was to isolate and
      characterize synovial cells from the human temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
      METHODS: Synovial cells were isolated using an explant culture method.
      Then, we characterized the cultured synovial cells (SGA2 cells) using
      immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: SGA2 cells expressed the fibroblastic
      markers vimentin and prolyl 4-hydroxylase; they also expressed laminin and
      heat shock protein 27, all of which are markers of type B cells. However,
      some cells expressed the macrophage marker CD68. These CD68-positive cells
      simultaneously expressed laminin. CONCLUSIONS: We isolated and cultured
      synovial type B cells from the human TMJ, and identified the presence of
      intermediate type synovial lining cells, having the phenotypic properties
      of both type A and type B cells, among the synovial lining cells.

TI  - Effects of topical treatment of sodium butyrate and 5-aminosalicylic acid
      on expression of trefoil factor 3, interleukin 1beta, and nuclear factor
      kappaB in trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid induced colitis in rats.
PG  - 130-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Butyrate enemas have been shown to be effective in
      treatment of ulcerative colitis, but the mechanism of the effects of
      butyrate is not totally known. This study evaluates effects of topical
      treatment of sodium butyrate (NaB) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) on
      the expression of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), interleukin 1beta (IL1beta),
      and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) in trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid
      (TNBS) induced colitis in rats. METHODS: Distal colitis was induced in
      male Wistar rats by colonic administration of TNBS and colonically treated
      with NaB, 5-ASA, combination of NaB and 5-ASA, and normal saline for 14
      consecutive days. Colonic damage score, tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO)
      activity, TFF3 mRNA expression, serum IL1beta production, and tissue
      NFkappaB expression were determined, respectively. RESULTS: Treatment of
      NaB, 5-ASA, and the combination improved diarrhoea, colonic damage score,
      and MPO activities, increased TFF3 mRNA expression, and decreased serum
      IL1beta production and tissue NFkappaB expression. The combination therapy
      of NaB and 5-ASA had better effects than any other single treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of topical treatment of NaB and 5-ASA was
      effective for relieving and repairing colonic inflammation and the effects
      were related to stimulation of TFF3 mRNA expression and down-regulation of
      IL1beta production and NFkappaB expression.

TI  - A MicroRNA signature associated with prognosis and progression in chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia.
PG  - 1793-801
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNA expression profiles can be used to distinguish normal
      B cells from malignant B cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL). We investigated whether microRNA profiles are associated
      with known prognostic factors in CLL. METHODS: We evaluated the microRNA
      expression profiles of 94 samples of CLL cells for which the level of
      expression of 70-kD zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), the mutational
      status of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region
      (IgV(H) ) gene, and the time from diagnosis to initial treatment were
      known. We also investigated the genomic sequence of 42 microRNA genes to
      identify abnormalities. RESULTS: A unique microRNA expression signature
      composed of 13 genes (of 190 analyzed) differentiated cases of CLL with
      low levels of ZAP-70 expression from those with high levels and cases with
      unmutated IgV(H) from those with mutated IgV(H) . The same microRNA
      signature was also associated with the presence or absence of disease
      progression. We also identified a germ-line mutation in the
      miR-16-1-miR-15a primary precursor, which caused low levels of microRNA
      expression in vitro and in vivo and was associated with deletion of the
      normal allele. Germ-line or somatic mutations were found in 5 of 42
      sequenced microRNAs in 11 of 75 patients with CLL, but no such mutations
      were found in 160 subjects without cancer (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A unique
      microRNA signature is associated with prognostic factors and disease
      progression in CLL. Mutations in microRNA transcripts are common and may
      have functional importance.

TI  - Induction of temperate cyanophage AS-1 by heavy metal--copper.
PG  - 17
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been reported that some marine cyanophage are temperate
      and can be induced from a lysogenic phase to a lytic phase by different
      agents such as heavy metals. However, to date no significant reports have
      focused on the temperate nature of freshwater cyanophage/cyanobacteria.
      Previous experiments with cyanophage AS-1 and cyanobacteria Anacystis
      nidulans have provided some evidence that AS-1 may have a lysogenic life
      cycle in addition to the characterized lytic cycle. RESULTS: In this
      study, the possible temperate A. nidulans was treated with different
      concentrations of heavy metal-copper. CuSO4 with concentrations of 3.1 x
      10(-3) M, 3.1 x 10(-4) M, 3.1 x 10(-5) M and 3.1 x 10(-6) M were used to
      detect the induction of AS-1 from A. nidulans. The population of the host,
      unicellular cyanobacteria Anacystis nidulans, was monitored by direct
      count and turbidity while the amount of virus produced was derived from
      plaque forming units (PFU) by a direct plating method. The ratio of AS-1
      release from A. nidulans was also determined. From these results it
      appears that AS-1 lysogenic phage can be induced by copper at
      concentrations from 3.1 x 10(-6) M to 3.1 x 10(-4) M. Maximal phage
      induction occurred at 6 hours after addition of copper, with an optimal
      concentration of 3.1 x 10(-6) M. CONCLUSION: Cu2+ is a significant inducer
      for lysogenic cyanobacterial cells and consequently would be a potential
      control agent in the cyanobacteria population in fresh water ecosystems.

TI  - Racial and ethnic disparities in access to physicians with HIV-related
      expertise.
PG  - 283-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Professional medical associations recommend that physicians who
      treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a measurable
      form of disease-specific expertise, such as high HIV patient volume or
      infectious diseases certification. Although it is known that racial/ethnic
      minorities generally have worse access to care than do whites, previous
      work has not examined disparities in the use of physicians with
      HIV-related expertise. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We linked data
      from a prospective cohort study of 2,207 persons with HIV receiving care
      in the United States with a cross-sectional survey of 404 physicians
      caring for them. Using multivariate analysis, we estimated the association
      of patient race/ethnicity with the experience and training of their
      physicians, controlling for health status, socioeconomic status,
      demographic characteristics, and geographic variation in provider supply.
      RESULTS: Compared with white patients, African Americans were less likely
      to have an infectious diseases specialist as a regular source of care
      (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.95).
      Persons of Alaskan Native, American Indian, Asian, Pacific Islander, or
      mixed racial background were also less likely than whites to have an
      infectious diseases specialist (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.83).
      Conversely, Latino patients had physicians whose HIV patient volume was,
      on average, 24% higher than the physicians of white patients (incident
      rate ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.50). CONCLUSIONS: Some groups of
      racial/ethnic minorities are less likely than are whites to have
      infectious diseases specialists as a regular source of care. The finding
      that the physicians of Latino patients had relatively higher HIV caseloads
      suggests that this particular patient subpopulation has access to HIV
      expertise. Further work to explain racial/ethnic differences in access to
      physicians will help in the design of programs and policies to eliminate
      them.

TI  - The interaction of lipophilic drugs with intestinal fatty acid-binding
      protein.
PG  - 17769-76
AB  - Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) is a small protein that
      binds long-chain dietary fatty acids in the cytosol of the columnar
      absorptive epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the intestine. The binding
      cavity of I-FABP is much larger than is necessary to bind a fatty acid
      molecule, which suggests that the protein may be able to bind other
      hydrophobic and amphipathic ligands such as lipophilic drugs. Herein we
      describe the binding of three structurally diverse lipophilic drugs,
      bezafibrate, ibuprofen (both R- and S-isomers) and nitrazepam to I-FABP.
      The rank order of affinity for I-FABP determined for these compounds was
      found to be R-ibuprofen approximately bezafibrate > S-ibuprofen >>
      nitrazepam. The binding affinities were not directly related to aqueous
      solubility or partition coefficient of the compounds; however, the freely
      water-soluble drug diltiazem showed no affinity for I-FABP. Drug-I-FABP
      interaction interfaces were defined by analysis of chemical shift
      perturbations in NMR spectra, which revealed that the drugs bound within
      the central fatty acid binding cavity. Each drug participated in a
      different set of interactions within the cavity; however, a number of
      common contacts were observed with residues also involved in fatty acid
      binding. These data suggest that the binding of non-fatty acid lipophilic
      drugs to I-FABP may increase the cytosolic solubility of these compounds
      and thereby facilitate drug transport from the intestinal lumen across the
      enterocyte to sites of distribution and metabolism.

TI  - Low dose pramipexole is neuroprotective in the MPTP mouse model of
      Parkinson's disease, and downregulates the dopamine transporter via the D3
      receptor.
PG  - 22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to determine if pramipexole, a D3 preferring
      agonist, effectively reduced dopamine neuron and fiber loss in the
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model when given
      at intraperitoneal doses corresponding to clinical doses. We also
      determined whether subchronic treatment with pramipexole regulates
      dopamine transporter function, thereby reducing intracellular transport of
      the active metabolite of MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+).
      METHODS: Ten 12-month old C57BL/6 mice were treated with MPTP (or saline)
      twice per day at 20 mg/kg s.c. (4 injections over 48 h). Mice were
      pretreated for 3 days and during the 2-day MPTP regimen with pramipexole
      (0.1 mg/kg/day) or saline. Stereological quantification of dopamine neuron
      number and optical density measurement of dopamine fiber loss were carried
      out at 1 week after treatment, using immunostaining for dopamine
      transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Additional wild-type (WT)
      and D3 receptor knockout (KO) mice were treated for 5 days with
      pramipexole (0.1 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. The kinetics of [3H]MPP+ and
      [3H]DA uptake (Vmax and Km) were determined 24 h later; and at 24 h and 14
      days dopamine transporter density was measured by quantitative
      autoradiography. RESULTS: Pramipexole treatment completely antagonized the
      neurotoxic effects of MPTP, as measured by substantia nigra and ventral
      tegmental area TH-immunoreactive cell counts. MPTP- induced loss of
      striatal innervation, as measured by DAT-immunoreactivity, was partially
      prevented by pramipexole, but not with regard to TH-IR. Pramipexole also
      reduced DAT- immunoreactivity in non-MPTP treated mice. Subchronic
      treatment with pramipexole lowered the Vmax for [3H]DA and [3H]MPP+ uptake
      into striatal synaptosomes of WT mice. Pramipexole treatment lowered Vmax
      in WT but not D3 KO mice; however, D3 KO mice had lower Vmax for [3H]DA
      uptake. There was no change in DAT number in WT with pramipexole treatment
      or D3 KO mice at 24 h post-treatment, but there was a reduction in
      WT-pramipexole treated and not in D3 KO mice at 14 days post-treatment.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that protection occurs at clinically
      suitable doses of pramipexole. Protection could be due to a reduced amount
      of MPP+ taken up into DA terminals via DAT. D3 receptor plays an important
      role in this regulation of transporter uptake and availability.

TI  - [Chromosomal disorders in the background of azoospermia].
PG  - 531-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nowadays more and more couples face the fact that they
      cannot have babies in spite of many years of trying. The male factor can
      be identified in about half of these cases. AIM: The aim of this study was
      to analyse chromosomal alterations in patients with azoospermia. These
      patients may be candidates for testicular sperm retrieval and
      intracytoplasmatic sperm injection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative
      evaluation included routine andrological investigation with 2 semen
      analysis, ultrasound, hormonal and genetic examination. Traditional
      histological examination and embryological diagnostic of tissue samples
      was performed. Cryopreservation of retrieved testicular tissue was also
      done. Between January 2001 and June 2005 73 biopsies were performed in 71
      patients for testicular sperm extraction. In order to obtain an exact
      diagnosis, the traditional cytogenetic methods and fluorescence in situ
      hybridization analyses were performed in combination with molecular
      genetic techniques. Patients were offered to participate in the assisted
      reproduction programme on the base of their genetic results. RESULTS: In
      this study, the most characteristic cases were numerical deviations, such
      as 47,XXY (2 cases), mosaic 47,XXY/49,XXXXY (1 case), 47,XYY (1 case) and
      mosaic 46,XY/45,X (1 case) karyotypes. Non-obstructive azoospermia was
      diagnosed in 53 patients (79%). CONCLUSIONS: Authors emphasised the
      importance of cyto- and molecular examinations in cases of genetical
      disorders. The results provide a chance for patients to be spared from
      long-drawn moreover psychological burdening examinations. In addition the
      costs of different clinical intervention could be saved too.

TI  - Cytokeratin autoantibodies: useful serologic markers for toluene
      diisocyanate-induced asthma.
PG  - 773-81
AB  - To evaluate the clinical significance of autoantibodies to three major
      epithelial cytokeratins (CK)--CK8, CK18, and CK19--we compared 66 patients
      with toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced asthma (group I) with three
      control groups: 169 asymptomatic exposed subjects (group II), 64 patients
      with allergic asthma (group III), and 123 unexposed healthy subjects
      (group IV). Serum IgG, specific for human recombinant CKs, were measured
      by ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), and ELISA inhibition tests
      were performed. The existence of these antibodies was confirmed by IgG
      immunoblot analysis. Anti-TDI-HSA (human serum albumin) IgE and IgG
      antibodies were measured by ELISA in the same set of the patients. The
      prevalence of CK8, CK18, and CK19 auotantibodies in group I was
      significantly higher than in the other three groups. Results of the ELISA
      inhibition test showed significant inhibition with the addition of three
      CKs in a dose-dependent manner. No significant association was found
      between CK autoantibodies and the prevalence of anti- TDI-HSA IgG and IgE
      antibodies. These results suggest that autoantibodies to CK18 and CK19 can
      be used as serologic markers for identifying patients with TDI-induced
      asthma among exposed workers.

TI  - Differences in hypoglycemia event rates and associated cost-consequence in
      patients initiated on long-acting and intermediate-acting insulin
      products.
PG  - 291-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare hypoglycemia event rates in patients initiated on
      long-acting insulin analog (glargine) or intermediate-acting insulin (NPH)
      and to analyze the associated cost-consequence from a managed care
      perspective. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of pharmacy and
      medical claims and electronic laboratory result data using a southeastern
      United States managed care health plan. METHODS: Patients newly initiated
      on glargine or NPH between July 1, 2000 and August 31, 2002 were included.
      Hypoglycemia events were identified from medical claims by their ICD-9CM
      codes. Multivariable techniques were used to compare hypoglycemia event
      rates between cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 1434 patients were eligible
      (glargine = 310, NPH = 1124). The mean age was 53 years +/- 17 years and
      51% of patients were male. The mean treatment duration was 8.6 months +/-
      4.5 months. Multivariate analyses showed that patients in the NPH group
      had a higher hypoglycemia event rate than the glargine group (18.3 versus
      7.3 per 100 patients per year; p = 0.009). The number needed to treat
      (glargine versus NPH) to avoid one hypoglycemia event per patient per year
      was nine patients at an A1C of 7%. The mean annual index medication cost
      was $47 more for glargine ($390) than for NPH ($343) per patient per year
      (p = 0.042). The mean cost per hypoglycemia event was $1087 (95% CI:
      $764-$1409). CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with glargine had significantly
      lower hypoglycemia event rates compared to the NPH group. The risk
      difference indicated that one hypoglycemia event would be avoided for
      every nine patients treated with glargine instead of NPH. The cost
      increase associated with treating nine patients with glargine rather than
      NPH is less than the cost of treating one hypoglycemia event. In this
      population, the savings associated with reduced hypoglycemic events more
      than offset the increased acquisition cost associated with glargine.

AB  - We report a case of primary cardiac epithelioid hemangioendothelioma
      arising from the right atrium of a 2-month-old infant. The tumor was found
      incidentally during exploratory sternotomy for recurrent pericardial
      effusion. This case represents a very rare situation, because this is the
      youngest patient found in relevant literature, and because it involves
      extensive infiltration by the tumor without any development of
      intracardiac mass appearance.

TI  - P2X receptors in mouse Leydig cells.
PG  - C1009-17
AB  - ATP-activated currents were studied in Leydig cells of mice with the
      patch-clamp technique. Whole cell currents were rapidly activating and
      slowly desensitizing (55% decrement from the peak value on exposure to 100
      microM ATP for 60 s), requiring 3 min of washout to recover 100% of the
      response. The concentration-response relationships for ATP, adenosine
      5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPgammaS), and 2-methylthio-ATP (2-MeS-ATP)
      were described by the Hill equation with a concentration evoking 50% of
      maximal ATP response (K(d)) of 44, 110, and 637 microM, respectively, and
      a Hill coefficient of 2. The order of efficacy of agonists was ATP >or=
      ATPgammaS > 2-MeS-ATP > 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP).
      alphabeta-Methylene-ATP (alphabeta-MeATP), GTP, UTP, cAMP, and adenosine
      were ineffective. Suramin and pyridoxal
      phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS) blocked the responses
      in a concentration-dependent manner. The ATP-activated currents were
      dependent on extracellular pH, being maximal at pH 6.5 and decreasing with
      both acidification and alkalinization (apparent dissociation constant
      (pK(a)) of 5.9 and 7.4, respectively). The whole cell current-voltage
      relationship showed inward rectification and reversed near 0 mV.
      Experiments performed in bi-ionic conditions for measurement of reversal
      potentials showed that this channel is highly permeable to calcium
      [permeability (P)(Ca)/P(Na) = 5.32], but not to chloride (P(Cl)/P(Na) =
      0.03) or N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) (P(NMDG)/P(Na) = 0.09). Unitary
      currents recorded in outside-out patches had a chord conductance of 27 pS
      (between -90 and -50 mV) and were inward rectifying. The average current
      passing through the excised patch decreased with time [time constant (tau)
      = 13 s], resembling desensitization of the macroscopic current. These
      findings indicate that the ATP receptor present in Leydig cells shows
      properties most similar to those of cloned homomeric P2X(2).

TI  - The effect of transdermal delivery of fentanyl on activity in growing
      pigs.
PG  - 149-57
AB  - Recently, decreased activity levels have been observed in pigs treated
      postoperatively with transdermal delivery of fentanyl (TD-fentanyl) after
      isoflurane anaesthesia. Whether the change in behaviour is related to
      opioid-induced sedation or to insufficient pain relief remains to be
      investigated. This study was therefore undertaken to evaluate the effect
      of TD-fentanyl 50 microg h(-1) on the activity level with and without
      isoflurane anaesthesia. Eight pigs (25.4 +/- 5.2 kg) were submitted to a
      cross-over study and given two treatments; 1) fentanyl patch applied after
      30 minutes of anaesthesia (treatment A/F) and 2) fentanyl patch without
      anaesthesia (treatment F). The pigs' behaviour was observed from a video
      recording instantaneously every 10 minutes for 24 h before treatments and
      up to 72 h after the patch attachment. Venous blood samples were taken 1,
      6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after the patch application. The behaviour
      recordings showed that TD-fentanyl did not produce sedation in any pig. No
      differences were found between the two treatments in activity level,
      weight gain or serum fentanyl concentration. This concentration measured
      after 24 h was 0.27 +/- 0.11 ng ml(-1) and 0.47 +/- 0.40 ng ml(-1) in the
      A/F and F group, respectively. In conclusion, transdermal delivery of 50
      microg h(-1) fentanyl did not cause inactivity in growing pigs. However,
      the large variations in serum fentanyl concentration indicate that drug
      absorption from transdermal patches is unpredictable and sometimes
      deficient.

TI  - alpha-Conotoxin GI benzoylphenylalanine derivatives. (1)H-NMR structures
      and photoaffinity labeling of the Torpedo californica nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptor.
PG  - 1373-88
AB  - alpha-Conotoxins are small peptides from cone snail venoms that function
      as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-competitive antagonists
      differentiating between nAChR subtypes. Current understanding about the
      mechanism of these selective interactions is based largely on mutational
      analyses, which identify amino acids in the toxin and nAChR that determine
      the energetics of ligand binding. To identify regions of the nAChR
      involved in alpha-conotoxin binding by use of photoactivated
      cross-linking, two benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) analogs of alpha-conotoxin
      GI, GI(Bpa12) and GI(Bpa4), were synthesized by replacing the respective
      residues with Bpa, and their (1)H-NMR structures were determined. Both
      analogs preserved the GI conformation, but only GI(Bpa12) displaced
      (125)I-labeled GI from the Torpedo californica nAChR. (125)I-labeled
      GI(Bpa12) bound to two sites on the receptor (K(d) 13 and 1800 nM), and on
      UV irradiation specifically photolabeled the alpha, gamma and delta
      subunits. Photolabeling sites were mapped by selective proteolysis and
      enzymatic deglycosylation, combined with SDS/PAGE, HPLC and Edman
      degradation. In the alpha subunit, cobratoxin-inhibited incorporation was
      limited to the 22-kDa fragment beginning at alphaSer173 and containing the
      agonist-binding site segment C. In the gamma subunit, radioactivity was
      localized to two distinct peptides containing agonist-binding site
      segments F and D: nonglycosylated 24-kDa and glycosylated 13-kDa fragments
      starting at gammaAla167 and gammaAla49, respectively. The labeling of
      these fragments is discussed in terms of a model of GI(Bpa12) bound to the
      extracellular domain of the Torpedo nAChR homology model derived from the
      cryo-electron microscopy structure of Torpedo marmorata nAChR and X-ray
      crystal structures of snail acetylcholine-binding protein complexes with
      agonists and antagonists.

TI  - Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy assay for quercetin and
      conjugated quercetin metabolites in human plasma and urine.
PG  - 194-201
AB  - A sensitive and specific method was developed and validated for the
      quantitation of quercetin in human plasma and urine. The application of
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with a
      TurboIonspray (TIS) interface in negative mode under multiple reactions
      monitoring was investigated. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a
      C12 column using a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water with 0.2% formic
      acid (pH 2.4) (40/60, v/v). The detection limit was 100 pg/ml and the
      lower limit of quantification was 500 pg/ml for plasma samples; the
      detection limit was 500 pg/ml and the lower limit of quantification was 1
      ng/ml for urine samples. The calibration curve was linear from 1 to 800
      ng/ml for plasma samples and was linear from 1 to 200 and 50 to 2000 ng/ml
      for urine samples. All the intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation
      were less than 11% and intra- and inter-day accuracies were within +/-15%
      of the known concentrations. This represents a LC/MS/MS assay with the
      sensitivity and specificity necessary to determine quercetin in human
      plasma and urine. This assay was used to determine both parent quercetin
      and the quercetin after enzymatic hydrolysis with
      beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase in human plasma and urine samples following
      the ingestion of quercetin 500 mg capsules.

TI  - Breast cancer risk factors and mammographic breast density in women over
      age 70.
PG  - 157-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer, but
      little is known about factors associated with breast density in women over
      70. METHODS: Percent breast density, sex hormone levels and breast cancer
      risk factor data were obtained on 239 women ages 70-92 recruited from 1986
      to 1988 in the United States. Multivariable linear regression was used to
      develop a model to describe factors associated with percent density.
      RESULTS: Median (range) percent density among women was 23.7% (0-85%).
      Body mass index (beta=-0.345, p<0.001 adjusted for age and parity) and
      parity (beta=-0.277, p<0.001 adjusted for age and BMI) were significantly
      and inversely associated with percent breast density. After adjusting for
      parity and BMI, age was not associated with breast density (beta=0.05,
      p=0.45). Parous women had lower percent density than nulliparous women
      (23.7 versus 34.7%, p=0.005). Women who had undergone surgical menopause
      had greater breast density than those who had had a natural menopause
      (33.4 versus 24.8%, p=0.048), as did women who were not current smokers
      (26.0 versus 17.3% for smokers, p=0.02). Breast density was not associated
      with age at menarche, age at menopause, age at first birth, breastfeeding,
      estrogen levels or androgen levels. In a multivariable model, 24% of the
      variance in percent breast density was explained by BMI (beta=-0.35),
      parity (beta=-0.29), surgical menopause (beta=0.13) and current smoking
      (beta=-0.12). CONCLUSION: Factors associated with breast density in older,
      post-menopausal women differ from traditional breast cancer risk factors
      and from factors associated with breast density in pre-menopausal and
      younger post-menopausal women.

AB  - Posture disorders and morphofunctional defect were studied in 44 patients
      with cerebral insult using computer anthropometry. Typical changes in
      anthropometric parameters in postinsult patient before and after
      restoration treatment are considered. It is shown that computer
      anthropometry provides adequate monitoring of the dynamics of posture
      disorders and morphofunctional defect in general. The changes in
      anthropometric parameters should be taken into account in diagnosis of
      motor disorders. Their monitoring can also be used to assess the quality
      of treatment of postinsult patients.

TI  - Construction of shRNA targeted to the rat angiotensin II type 1 receptors
      and its RNAi in cytoplasma.
PG  - 4-8
AB  - The expression vector of shRNA targeted to the rat angiotensin II receptor
      gene was constructed and the efficacy of siRNAs to modulate the expression
      of target gene in the in vitro cultured mammalian cells was investigated
      for antihypertensive therapy in spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) at
      post-transcriptional level. The sense and antisense RNA oligonucleotides
      strands targeting angiotensin II receptor mRNA were synthesized
      individually according to the sequence of the rat angiotensin II receptor.
      For preparation of duplexes, sense- and antisense-stranded
      oligonucleotides were mixed and annealed, and the annealed duplexes were
      cloned into the pGenesil-1 vector. . The rat glioma cells were transfected
      with constructed pGenesil-1-shRNA plasmid and scrambled plasmid. The
      cultured cells were collected at different phases. RT-PCR and Western blot
      were performed. The AT1 mRNA and protein levels behaved ultimately same.
      Compared to control after 48 h, AT1 mRNA levels were decreased to 35.5%
      +/- 3.0%, and the levels reached their lowest point after 72 h (20.7% +/-
      4% of control). At 24 and 48 h, AT1 protein was reduced to 46.9% +/- 4. 2%
      and 36.98% +/- 3.7% respectively compared to control and a maximum
      reduction was observed after 72 h of incubation (28.1% +/- 4% compared to
      controls). Plasmid-based shRNA expression systems targeted against the rat
      angiotensin II receptor gene were generated successfully. The shRNAs with
      a 22-nt stem and a short loop were cleaved into small interfering dsRNA
      (siRNA) by the Dicer. The in vitro transcribed siRNA enables the effective
      silencing of gene expression to the target mRNA and leads to effective
      inhibition of translation of proteins and will be lay the foundation of
      application of gene silencing technology to hypertensive rats.

PG  - 41-7
AB  - AIM: To analyse data on patients who developed catastrophic
      antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) in primary and secondary APS, to assess
      outcomes of CAPS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed retrospectively the
      data on 164 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and APS, on
      76 patients with primary APS (PAPS) treated in the Institute of
      Rheumatology from 1989. Verification of vascular complications was made
      using ultrasonic dopplerography (UDG) of peripheral vessels,
      echocardiography of the heart, CT of the brain, abdominal organs.
      Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLab) and lupus anticoagulant (LA) served as
      serological markers of APS. RESULTS: In the observation period of 9.4 +/-
      4.2 years, 33 patients (23 females and 10 males) out of 164 patients with
      SLE+APS developed CAPS, 8 of them survived while 25 died. CAPS patients
      had no differences by age, duration of the disease, its activity and
      symptoms from patients who had no CAPS. Ten out of 76 patients with PAPS
      developed CAPS, 7 of them died. The analysis of the concomitant factors
      which may initiate PAPS showed that in SLE and APS these factors consisted
      of initial menopause (n = 2), infection (n = 12), including pneumonia (n =
      7), acute respiratory disease (n = 3), food poisoning (n = 1), abscess (n
      = 1). Cancer was in one patient, trauma after road accident in one
      patient. Trigger factor was not determined in 13 patients. In PAPS
      provoking factors were pneumonia (n = 2) and abscess (n = 1), in 7
      patients these factors were not detected. CONCLUSION: Any infection in SLE
      patients should be adequately treated with antibiotics; APS patients
      treated surgically should receive parenteral anticoagulants instead of
      oral ones; puerperas with APS must receive adequate parenteral
      anticoagulant therapy for at least 6 weeks; in exacerbation of SLE, APS
      patients should receive parenteral anticoagulants with following
      hypocoagulation with oral anticoagulants.

TI  - Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in patients with chronic
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 1209-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative effectiveness of second-generation (atypical)
      antipsychotic drugs as compared with that of older agents has been
      incompletely addressed, though newer agents are currently used far more
      commonly. We compared a first-generation antipsychotic, perphenazine, with
      several newer drugs in a double-blind study. METHODS: A total of 1493
      patients with schizophrenia were recruited at 57 U.S. sites and randomly
      assigned to receive olanzapine (7.5 to 30 mg per day), perphenazine (8 to
      32 mg per day), quetiapine (200 to 800 mg per day), or risperidone (1.5 to
      6.0 mg per day) for up to 18 months. Ziprasidone (40 to 160 mg per day)
      was included after its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The
      primary aim was to delineate differences in the overall effectiveness of
      these five treatments. RESULTS: Overall, 74 percent of patients
      discontinued the study medication before 18 months (1061 of the 1432
      patients who received at least one dose): 64 percent of those assigned to
      olanzapine, 75 percent of those assigned to perphenazine, 82 percent of
      those assigned to quetiapine, 74 percent of those assigned to risperidone,
      and 79 percent of those assigned to ziprasidone. The time to the
      discontinuation of treatment for any cause was significantly longer in the
      olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (P<0.001) or risperidone (P=0.002)
      group, but not in the perphenazine (P=0.021) or ziprasidone (P=0.028)
      group. The times to discontinuation because of intolerable side effects
      were similar among the groups, but the rates differed (P=0.04); olanzapine
      was associated with more discontinuation for weight gain or metabolic
      effects, and perphenazine was associated with more discontinuation for
      extrapyramidal effects. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in each
      group discontinued their assigned treatment owing to inefficacy or
      intolerable side effects or for other reasons. Olanzapine was the most
      effective in terms of the rates of discontinuation, and the efficacy of
      the conventional antipsychotic agent perphenazine appeared similar to that
      of quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone. Olanzapine was associated
      with greater weight gain and increases in measures of glucose and lipid
      metabolism.

TI  - Anti-atherosclerotic effect of amlodipine, alone and in combination with
      atorvastatin, in APOE*3-Leiden/hCRP transgenic mice.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - We investigated the pleiotropic effects of a calcium antagonist
      (amlodipine) on early atherosclerosis development in the presence and
      absence of an HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor (atorvastatin) in apolipoprotein
      E*3-Leiden/human C-reactive protein (E3L/CRP) transgenic mice. Male
      E3L/CRP transgenic mice were fed a cholesterol-containing diet either with
      or without amlodipine and/or atorvastatin. After 31 weeks, atherosclerosis
      in the aortic root area was quantified. Treatment with amlodipine did not
      significantly lower blood pressure, but resulted in a 43% reduction (P <
      0.03) of lesion area as compared with the untreated group. Treatment with
      atorvastatin resulted in an 80% reduction of lesion area as compared with
      the untreated group (P < 0.001). Combined treatment with amlodipine and
      atorvastatin decreased the lesion area by 93%, significantly more than
      either treatment alone (P < 0.008). Plasma C-reactive protein levels were
      mildly elevated, on average 10 +/- 6 mg/L, and did not differ between
      groups, neither on baseline nor during treatment. Treatment with
      amlodipine, independently of blood pressure lowering, reduced
      atherosclerosis development in E3L/CRP mice. Atorvastatin had a strong
      anti-atherosclerotic effect, whereas co-treatment with amlodipine enhanced
      this effect significantly. Plasma C-reactive protein levels were not
      affected by any of the three treatments.

TI  - Expression of nuclear factor-kappaB and its clinical significance in
      nonsmall-cell lung cancer.
PG  - 243-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been known that transcription factor nuclear factor
      (NF)-kappaB plays an important role in cell proliferation and oncogenesis.
      The aims of this study were to evaluate expression levels of NF-kappaB in
      nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to elucidate its clinical
      significance and prognostic value for patients with NSCLC. METHODS: Using
      45 tumor tissue specimens from 45 patients with NSCLC who underwent
      surgery, we investigated the expression of NF-kappaB using Western
      blotting analysis. Apoptotic rate of NSCLC cells with different expression
      of NF-kappaB was determined by TUNEL (terminal
      deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling) assay.
      Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 71 consecutive patients with NSCLC
      were obtained for immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The expression
      level of NF-kappaB in poorly or moderately differentiated lung cancer
      cells was higher than that in well-differentiated ones (p = 0.001). The
      apoptotic rate was lower for lung cancer cells with higher NF-kappaB
      expression than for those with lower NF-kappaB expression (p = 0.0238).
      Furthermore, expression of NF-kappaB was correlated with caspase-3,
      cyclooxygenase-2, and p53 expression in lung cancer cells that were
      examined. Most NSCLC cells showed nuclear staining pattern and the nuclear
      positive rate was 67.6% (48 of 71 specimens). Immunohistochemical
      NF-kappaB expression in patients with NSCLC was an independent prognostic
      factor for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study
      suggest that expression of NF-kappaB may correlate with lung cancer
      differentiation. Overexpression of NF-kappaB inhibits tumor cell apoptosis
      and indicates an unfavorable prognosis for overall survival in some
      patients with NSCLC.

TI  - Cytoplasmic function of mutant promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and
      PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha.
PG  - 14465-73
AB  - The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) tumor suppressor of acute promyelocytic
      leukemia (APL) regulates major apoptotic and growth-suppressive pathways.
      In APL, PML is involved in a chromosomal translocation generating the
      PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha) fusion protein. Two missense
      mutations in the remaining PML alleles have been identified, which give
      rise to a truncated cytoplasmic PML protein (Mut PML). APL patients
      carrying these mutations display resistance to retinoic acid (RA) and very
      poor prognosis. Here we show that Mut PML associates with the cytoplasmic
      regions we refer to as PML-cytoplasmic bodies (PML-CBs). Mut PML interacts
      with PML-RARalpha in PML-CB and potentiates PML-RARalpha-mediated
      inhibition of RA-dependent transcription. Remarkably, Mut PML stabilizes
      PML-RARalpha and inhibits differentiation induced by pharmacological doses
      of RA. A mutant form of PML-RARalpha that accumulates in the cytoplasm
      inhibits RA-dependent transcription and differentiation, thus suggesting
      that cytoplasmic localization of PML-RARalpha may contribute to
      transformation. Finally, we show that the bcr3 PML-RARalpha form is
      predominantly cytoplasmic and accumulates in PML-CBs. Taken together,
      these findings reveal novel insights into the molecular mechanisms
      contributing to APL.

TI  - [Cerebral hydatid cysts in children: 4 cases].
PG  - 434-7
AB  - The cerebral localization of the hydatid disease is rare, under 2%, and it
      primarily affects children. We report 4 cases of children presenting with
      a cerebral hydatid cyst (2 boys and 2 girls, mean age 9 years). Clinical
      symptoms were very progressive, the disease was frequently diagnosed
      several months (1-12 months) after onset of symptoms most often headaches
      and vomiting. One patient presented with a right tonic-clonic seizure 3
      days before hospitalization. The diagnostic was confirmed in all cases by
      Cerebral CT scan. All the patients were screened for other localizations.
      One patient also presented with pulmonary and hepatic hydatid cysts.
      Hydatid blood tests were positive in only one case. The treatment was
      surgical for all the patients (using hydropulsion) without complications
      in 2 cases. One child presented with meningitis, and the other child with
      signs of secondary ICHT related to residual mass which required its
      puncture.

TI  - BAP31 and its caspase cleavage product regulate cell surface expression of
      tetraspanins and integrin-mediated cell survival.
PG  - 30018-24
AB  - BAP31, a resident integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane,
      regulates the export of other integral membrane proteins to the downstream
      secretory pathway. Here we show that cell surface expression of the
      tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 is compromised in mouse cells from which the
      Bap31 gene has been deleted. CD9 and CD81 facilitate the function of
      multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane, including integrins. Of
      note, BAP31 does not appear to influence the egress of alpha5beta1 or
      alpha(v)beta3 integrins to the cell surface, but in Bap31-null mouse
      cells, these integrins are not able to maintain cellular adhesion to the
      extracellular matrix in the presence of reduced serum. Consequently,
      Bap31-null cells are sensitive to serum starvation-induced apoptosis.
      Reconstitution of wild-type BAP31 into these Bap31-null cells restores
      integrin-mediated cell attachment and cell survival after serum stress,
      whereas interference with the functions of CD9, alpha5beta1, or
      alpha(v)beta3 by antagonizing antibodies makes BAP31 cells act similar to
      Bap31-null cells in these respects. Finally, in human KB epithelial cells
      protected from apoptosis by BCL-2, the caspase-8 cleavage product, p20
      BAP31, inhibits egress of tetraspanin and integrin-mediated cell
      attachment. Thus, p20 BAP31 can operate upstream of BCL-2 in living cells
      to influence cell surface properties due to its effects on protein egress
      from the endoplasmic reticulum.

TI  - Calcified fibromatosis of the neck in 4-year old girl: rapid growth, rapid
      therapy.
PG  - 847-52
AB  - Fibromatosis is a rare soft tissue disease typical for infants and
      characterized by fibroblastic proliferation, which may appear similar to
      fibrosarcoma. An unusual case of 4-year old girl presenting large tumor of
      the neck with massive calcification is described. The growth of the tumor
      was rapid and mediastinal involvement was observed. The final diagnosis
      showed benign nature of tumor with microscopic features of fibromatosis
      calcificans. After surgical resection of neck tumor, residual mass
      persisted both in the neck and in the mediastinum in 6 years of follow-up
      without signs of progression.

TI  - Influence of growth phase on the phospholipidic fatty acid composition of
      two marine bacterial strains in pure and mixed cultures.
PG  - 479-86
AB  - This in vitro study was conducted in order to determine the effects of
      hydrocarbons and growth phase on the phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid
      composition of two marine sedimentary hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria.
      These two strains, namely Corynebacterium sp. and Sphingomonas sp. 2MPII,
      were cultivated on either a simple soluble substrate (ammonium acetate) or
      a hydrocarbon (respectively n-eicosane and phenanthrene). The incubations
      were stopped at different times corresponding to point of lag (2 days),
      exponential (7 days) and stationary phases (21 and 56 days). The effects
      of growth phase and hydrophobic substrates were successfully demonstrated
      by a simple index, given as the sum of saturated fatty acids divided by
      the sum of unsaturated fatty acids ( summation operatorSFA/ summation
      operatorMUFA), ranging from 1.4 to 3, 0.3 to 0.6, and 0.5 to 1.0 for
      Corynebacterium sp., Sphingomonas sp. 2MPII, and mixed cultures,
      respectively. This result was validated by a principal component analysis.
      In pure cultures, the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition was
      strongly influenced by both the carbon source and the growth phase.
      Nevertheless, the two strains showed different "behaviors". For 2MPII, the
      main PLFA composition changes were observed at 2 days while they were
      progressive as a function of time for Corynebacterium sp. These
      differences could explain the evolution of PLFAs of mixed cultures.

TI  - RhoC promotes human melanoma invasion in a PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway.
PG  - 862-8
AB  - Overexpression of the small GTPase, RhoC, in various human cancers has
      been correlated with high metastatic ability and poor prognosis.
      Rho-kinase (ROCK) is an important effector of Rho GTPases. The oncogenic
      serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as PKB) is a downstream effector
      of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). Akt activation contributes to the
      neoplastic phenotype by promoting cell cycle progression, increasing
      antiapoptotic functions, and enhancing tumor cell invasion. Rho signaling
      via ROCK has been previously shown either to activate or to downregulate
      PI3K/Akt. Using a human radial growth phase melanoma cell line, WM35, we
      have established stable transfectants that overexpress RhoC (called
      WM35RhoC). We found that overexpression of RhoC increased
      phosphorylated-Akt (Ser473/474/472, pAkt) expression and promoted cell
      invasion. Inhibition of RhoC with C3 transferase downregulated pAkt
      expression and decreased cell invasion in these cells. In addition,
      inhibition of PI3K, Akt, or ROCK partially decreased invasion. Further,
      inhibition of PI3K but not ROCK decreased the pAkt level. These results
      suggest that RhoC promotes invasion in part via activation of a PI3K/Akt
      pathway, in a manner independent of ROCK signaling. We propose that RhoC
      promotes melanoma progression via separate mechanisms that regulate the
      PI3K/Akt pathway and the ROCK signaling pathway.

TI  - Effect of Korean oriental medicine extract on bone mass as compared with
      alendronate in ovariectomized rats.
PG  - 369-76
AB  - A number of alternative medicines (AMs) have often been used as
      traditional therapies for various diseases without scientific or clinical
      evidence supporting their use. The present study examined the
      pharmaceutical effects of an AM extract with a long history of use as a
      traditional medicine for various bone diseases. To evaluate it as a
      potential candidate for use as an anti-osteoporotic drug, we investigated
      the effects of the AM extract on the progression of bone loss in
      ovariectomized (OVX) rats fed a calcium (Ca)-deficient diet for 4 or 12
      weeks. We also compared the AM extract with alendronate, an
      anti-resorptive drug. The AM extract did not influence bone turnover as
      indicated by biochemical markers [i.e., deoxypyridinoline (DPD)]. In
      contrast, alendronate treatment seemed to reduce bone turnover via
      inhibition of bone resorption as evidenced by reduced urinary DPD
      concentrations accompanied by a tendency for decreased serum
      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. Administration of alendronate or AM
      extracts did not significantly affect bone density, although both tended
      to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength of the femur.
      Although both treatments did not affect vertebral BMD and bone strength,
      histological analysis of vertebrae showed well-developed trabecular
      networking in OVX rats treated with alendronate or AM extract, in contrast
      to the thin and disconnected trabecule in OVX rats. In conclusion, the AM
      extract produced a very weak effect on the prevention of bone loss induced
      by OVX and Ca deficiency in rats, but was similar to the results observed
      with alendronate. Further verification is necessary to justify the use of
      the AM extract as a treatment for osteoporosis.

TI  - Mast cell and neutrophil peptidases attack an inactivation segment in
      hepatocyte growth factor to generate NK4-like antagonists.
PG  - 1489-94
AB  - Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a plasminogen-like protein with an alpha
      chain linked to a trypsin-like beta chain without peptidase activity. The
      interaction of HGF with c-met, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by
      many cells, is important in cell growth, migration, and formation of
      endothelial and epithelial tubes. Stimulation of c-met requires two-chain,
      disulfide-linked HGF. Portions of an alpha chain containing an N-terminal
      segment and four kringle domains (NK4) antagonize HGF activity. Until now,
      no physiological pathway for generating NK4 was known. Here we show that
      chymases, which are chymotryptic peptidases secreted by mast cells,
      hydrolyze HGF, thereby abolishing scatter factor activity while generating
      an NK4-like antagonist of HGF scatter factor activity. Thus, chymase
      interferes with HGF directly by destroying active protein and indirectly
      by generating an antagonist. The site of hydrolysis, Leu480, lies in the
      alpha chain on the N-terminal side of the cysteine linking the alpha and
      beta chains. This site appears to be specific for HGF because chymase does
      not hydrolyze other plasminogen-like proteins, such as
      macrophage-stimulating protein and plasminogen itself. Mast
      cell/neutrophil cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase generate similar
      fragments of HGF by cleaving near the chymase site. Mast cell and
      neutrophil peptidases are secreted during tissue injury, infection,
      ischemia, and allergic inflammation, where they may oppose HGF effects on
      epithelial repair. Thus, HGF possesses an "inactivation segment" that
      serves as an Achilles' heel attacked by inflammatory proteases. This work
      reveals a potential physiological pathway for inactivation of HGF and
      generation of NK4-like antagonists.

TI  - [Susceptibility of Aedes aegypti larvae to the insecticide temephos in the
      Federal District, Brazil].
PG  - 623-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the susceptibility status of Aedes aegypti to the
      organophosphate insecticide temephos. METHODS: Samples of Ae. aegypti
      larvae were obtained, using ovitraps, from eight cities of the Federal
      District, central Brazil, in 2000 and 2001. Larvae were submitted to the
      diagnostic dose of 0.012 mg/l temephos, as recommended by standard World
      Health Organization methodology. Field populations were tested in parallel
      with reference strains Rockefeller and DIVAL, from the Environmental
      Surveillance Directory (DIVAL) insectary. The concentration and purity of
      temephos solutions were verified by gas chromatography. Correlation
      calculations were performed using StatView - SAS Institute Inc., version
      5. Student's t test was used for detecting differences in susceptibility,
      with significance levels of alpha=0.05. RESULTS: In 2000, Ae. aegypti
      larvae populations from Taguatinga, Guara, and Nucleo Bandeirante showed
      resistance to temephos, with mortality ranging from 54.1 to 63.4%. The
      populations from Gama, Planaltina, and Sobradinho showed altered levels of
      susceptibility (mortality ranging from 83.6 to 92.8%). The population from
      Ceilandia was the only susceptible one, with 98% mortality. In 2001, all
      populations tested were resistant (44.4 to 66.4% mortality). No
      significant correlation was found between the susceptibility of
      populations and the distance between the cities of origin, or the amount
      of insecticide applied in the years preceding the study. CONCLUSIONS: Ae.
      aegypti susceptibility to temephos is changing in the Federal District. It
      is essential to continue monitoring the resistance of this vector to
      insecticides in order to ensure the efficiency of programs aimed at vector
      control and at the protection of human health.

TI  - Strategies for preclinical evaluation of dendritic cell subsets for
      promotion of transplant tolerance in the nonhuman primate.
PG  - 955-65
AB  - A role for dendritic cells (DC) as critical regulators of immune
      reactivity has become increasingly recognized. There is evidence in rodent
      models that donor-derived DC, particularly in the immature state, can
      prolong organ allograft survival and even induce donor-specific tolerance.
      To allow the potential tolerogenic properties of these cells to be
      evaluated more fully with a view to clinical testing, it is necessary to
      identify DC subsets in nonhuman primates. We have identified the putative
      rhesus monkey equivalents of circulating human DC subset precursors as
      lineage(-), HLA-DR(+), CD123(lo),CD11c(hi)(pDC1) and lineage(-),
      HLA-DR(+), CD123(hi),CD11c(lo)(pDC2). Testing of these DC populations both
      in vitro and in vivo, as well as in transplant models in combination with
      conventional or experimental immunosuppressive reagents, will aid the
      development of novel strategies for the promotion of allo-antigen specific
      tolerance in transplantation.

TI  - Lack of association between two polymorphisms of brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor and response to typical neuroleptics.
PG  - 885-90
AB  - Several studies have connected brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
      with treatment response to neuroleptics. In recent studies, the BDNF
      expression was reduced by typical neuroleptics. We conducted a
      retrospective study on 94 patients with schizophrenia and 98 controls. The
      BDNF G196A and C270T polymorphisms are not associated with treatment
      response to typical neuroleptics or with age at first hospitalization.
      Moreover, these polymorphisms of the BDNF gene are not associated with the
      risk of schizophrenia.

TI  - Beneficial effects of intrathecal IGF-1 administration in patients with
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 768-72
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a transgenic mouse model of ALS,
      intrathecal infusion of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 showed a
      promising increase in survival. We performed a double-blind clinical trial
      to assess the effect of intrathecal administration of IGF-1 on disease
      progression in patients with ALS. METHODS: Nine patients with ALS were
      randomly assigned to receive either a high dose (3 microg/kg of body
      weight) or low dose (0.5 microg/kg of body weight) of IGF-1 every 2 weeks
      for 40 weeks. The outcome measurements were the rate of decline of bulbar
      and limb functions (Norris scales) and forced vital capacity. RESULTS: The
      high-dose treatment slowed a decline of motor functions of the ALS
      patients in total Norris and limb Norris scales, but not in bulbar Norris
      or vital capacity. The intrathecal administration of IGF-1 had a modest
      but significant beneficial effect in ALS patients without any serious
      adverse effects. DISCUSSION: Intrathecal IGF-1 treatment could provide an
      effective choice for ALS although further studies in more patients are
      needed to confirm its efficacy and optimize dosages of IGF-1.

TI  - DnaA couples DNA replication and the expression of two cell cycle master
      regulators.
PG  - 346-56
AB  - Cell cycle progression in Caulobacter is driven by the master
      transcriptional regulators CtrA and GcrA. The cellular levels of CtrA and
      GcrA are temporally and spatially out-of-phase during the cell cycle, with
      CtrA repressing gcrA transcription and GcrA activating ctrA transcription.
      Here, we show that DnaA, a protein required for the initiation of DNA
      replication, also functions as a transcriptional activator of gcrA, which
      in turn activates multiple genes, notably those involved in chromosome
      replication and segregation. The cellular concentration of DnaA is cell
      cycle-controlled, peaking at the time of replication initiation and gcrA
      induction. Regulated proteolysis of GcrA contributes to the cell cycle
      variations in GcrA abundance. We propose that DnaA couples DNA replication
      initiation with the expression of the two oscillating regulators GcrA and
      CtrA and that the DnaA/GcrA/CtrA regulatory cascade drives the forward
      progression of the Caulobacter cell cycle.

TI  - Search and identification of spermatozoa and spermatids in the ejaculate
      of non-obstructive azoospermic patients.
PG  - 42-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To search and to identify spermatozoa and spermatids, present
      in the ejaculate of non-obstructive azoospermic patients. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: 27 patients, aged between 18 and 48 years, with initial diagnosis
      compatible with non-obstructive azoospermia, underwent up to 3 seminal
      samples, with assessment of macroscopic and microscopic parameters
      differentiated for each sample. In the first sample, 5 microL of semen
      were analyzed in a Horwell chamber in order to assess the presence or
      absence of spermatozoa. The procedure was repeated with 2 other aliquots.
      In the absence of spermatozoa, the entire sample was transferred to a
      conic tube and following centrifugation the sediment was freshly analyzed.
      The second seminal sample was collected only when no spermatozoa were
      found in the first sample and the research was performed in the same way.
      In cases where spermatozoa were not seen, the sample was centrifuged and
      the obtained sediment was stained by the panoptic method and observed
      under common light microscopy (1250X). The third seminal sample was
      collected only in cases when patients had not shown spermatozoa in the
      first and second seminal samples. RESULTS: 4/27 (14.8%) patients presented
      spermatozoa in the first seminal sample and 6/23 (26.1%), in the second
      seminal sample. No spermatozoa were seen in the third sample, however,
      11/17 (64.7%) presented spermatids. CONCLUSION: In clinical situations
      where the initial diagnosis is non-obstructive azoospermia, one single
      routine seminal analysis is not enough to confirm this diagnosis and the
      analysis of the centrifuged sediment can have relevant clinical
      consequences. Among patients considered non-obstructive azoospermic, when
      duly assessed, 37% presented spermatozoa and 64.7%, spermatids.

TI  - Initial experience with oral valganciclovir for pre-emptive
      cytomegalovirus therapy after lung transplantation.
PG  - 480-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common opportunistic viral pathogen after lung
      transplantation is cytomegalovirus (CMV). Oral valganciclovir, a prodrug
      of ganciclovir, has been introduced as a potential drug for prophylaxis
      and treatment of CMV infection and disease in lung transplantation. The
      goal of this study was to describe our initial experience with oral
      valganciclovir for pre-emptive treatment of CMV infections after lung
      transplantation. METHODS AND PATIENTS: We summarize our experience with 19
      patients who underwent lung transplantation and received pre-emptive oral
      valganciclovir therapy in the situation of positive CMV polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) in either plasma or bronchoalveolar lavage. None of the
      patients presented with manifest CMV disease. Treatment dosage of
      valganciclovir was 450 mg to 1800 mg daily, depending on renal function
      and white blood count. Treatment was continued until the CMV PCR became
      negative, in any case for a period of at least 14 days. RESULTS: Three
      patients received two courses of pre-emptive oral valganciclovir; 16
      patients were treated once. Eleven patients (57.9%) were treated because
      of a positive plasma CMV PCR; in eight patients (42.1%) the PCR was
      positive only in bronchoalveolar lavage. Therapy was initiated 896 +/-
      1186 days (range, 108-3911) after transplantation with a mean CMV PCR of
      45,536 +/- 149,294 copies (range, 426-706,000). In all cases the PCR fell
      below detectability (<400 copies) after a period of 22 +/- 10 days of
      treatment (range, 7-50 days). Mild to moderate leucopenia was observed in
      seven patients (36.8%) during treatment. None of the patients developed
      new onset of other potentially drug-related disorders such as neutropenia,
      anemia, deterioration of renal function or gastrointestinal disorder.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pre-emptive therapy with oral valganciclovir for CMV
      infections detected by PCR in either plasma or bronchoalveolar lavage
      after lung transplantation seems to be efficacious and safe. However,
      regular blood counts should be performed to detect developing leucopenia.

TI  - Calcium at fertilization and in early development.
PG  - 25-88
AB  - Fertilization calcium waves are introduced, and the evidence from which we
      can infer general mechanisms of these waves is presented. The two main
      classes of hypotheses put forward to explain the generation of the
      fertilization calcium wave are set out, and it is concluded that
      initiation of the fertilization calcium wave can be most generally
      explained in invertebrates by a mechanism in which an activating substance
      enters the egg from the sperm on sperm-egg fusion, activating the egg by
      stimulating phospholipase C activation through a src family kinase pathway
      and in mammals by the diffusion of a sperm-specific phospholipase C from
      sperm to egg on sperm-egg fusion. The fertilization calcium wave is then
      set into the context of cell cycle control, and the mechanism of
      repetitive calcium spiking in mammalian eggs is investigated. Evidence
      that calcium signals control cell division in early embryos is reviewed,
      and it is concluded that calcium signals are essential at all three stages
      of cell division in early embryos. Evidence that phosphoinositide
      signaling pathways control the resumption of meiosis during oocyte
      maturation is considered. It is concluded on balance that the evidence
      points to a need for phosphoinositide/calcium signaling during resumption
      of meiosis. Changes to the calcium signaling machinery occur during
      meiosis to enable the production of a calcium wave in the mature oocyte
      when it is fertilized; evidence that the shape and structure of the
      endoplasmic reticulum alters dynamically during maturation and after
      fertilization is reviewed, and the link between ER dynamics and the
      cytoskeleton is discussed. There is evidence that calcium signaling plays
      a key part in the development of patterning in early embryos.
      Morphogenesis in ascidian, frog, and zebrafish embryos is briefly
      described to provide the developmental context in which calcium signals
      act. Intracellular calcium waves that may play a role in axis formation in
      ascidian are discussed. Evidence that the Wingless/calcium signaling
      pathway is a strong ventralizing signal in Xenopus, mediated by
      phosphoinositide signaling, is adumbrated. The central role that calcium
      channels play in morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and in
      ectodermal and mesodermal gene expression during late gastrulation is
      demonstrated. Experiments in zebrafish provide a strong indication that
      calcium signals are essential for pattern formation and organogenesis.

TI  - Value of preoperative serum CA125 in early-stage adenocarcinoma of the
      uterine cervix without pelvic lymph node metastasis.
PG  - 591-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This investigation attempted to clarify the value of
      preoperative serum CA125 in predicting histopathological prognostic
      factors for early-stage cervical adenocarcinoma without lymph node
      metastasis. METHODS: This study initially surveyed 163 patients with
      clinical stage Ib or IIa cervical adenocarcinoma treated with radical
      hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Of the 163 patients, 116 had
      preoperative serum CA125 levels, and 14 had pelvic lymph node metastasis.
      The investigation group comprised 102 lymph node-negative patients.
      RESULTS: A cutoff value of 26 U/ml was obtained after the discriminant
      function analysis for identifying patients with positive lymph vascular
      space invasion (LVSI) or depth of stromal invasion > or =2/3 thickness.
      Multivariate analysis revealed that among the preoperative
      clinicopathological variables, including age, tumor size, parametrial
      invasion, and CA125 level, raised CA125 most significantly influenced the
      assessment of the LVSI (P = 0.040) and depth of cervical stromal invasion
      (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In early-stage cervical adenocarcinoma with
      negative pelvic lymph node metastasis, preoperative serum CA125 levels at
      the cutoff value of 26 U/ml impacted the determination of the poor
      histopathological prognostic factors.

TI  - Aberrant auditory processing and atypical planum temporale in
      developmental stuttering.
PG  - 1640-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To learn if people with persistent developmental stuttering and
      atypical anatomy of their auditory temporal cortex have, when compared to
      control subjects, changes in fluency induced with delayed auditory
      feedback (DAF). BACKGROUND: DAF improves fluency in many individuals who
      stutter, and induces dysfluency in some normal people. The planum
      temporale (PT), a portion of auditory temporal cortex, is anatomically
      atypical in some adults who stutter and atypical anatomy might induce
      aberrant function. Thus, the people who demonstrate the paradoxical
      response to DAF might be those who have atypical anatomy. METHODS:
      Experimental subjects were adults with developmental stuttering (n = 14)
      and control subjects (n = 14) matched for age, sex, education, and
      handedness. Volumetric MRI scans of all subjects were obtained and the PT
      was measured in the right and left hemispheres. Based on these scans,
      subjects were classified as typical (leftward PT asymmetry) or atypical
      (rightward PT asymmetry). Prose passages were read at baseline, with
      non-altered feedback (NAF), and with DAF, and fluency was measured in
      these three conditions. RESULTS: At baseline the adults with developmental
      stuttering were significantly more dysfluent than controls (p < 0.0005).
      Controls' fluency did not significantly change with DAF, but DAF improved
      fluency in adults with developmental stuttering (p < 0.0005). In the
      stutter group enhanced fluency was associated with atypical (rightward) PT
      asymmetry, and the presence of typical (leftward) PT asymmetry was not
      associated with any significant change in fluency. The individuals with
      atypical PT asymmetry also had more severe stuttering at baseline compared
      to the experimental subjects with typical PT anatomy. CONCLUSIONS: In
      adults with persistent developmental stuttering and atypical PT anatomy,
      fluency is improved with DAF. These experimental subjects who showed
      improvement had more severe stuttering at baseline. Anomalous PT anatomy
      may be a neural risk for developmental stuttering in some individuals.
      Although a number of explanations are tenable, it may be that atypical
      rightward PT asymmetry may alter speech feedback, and treatment with DAF
      might allow these people to compensate.

TI  - Prevalence and diagnosis of schizophrenia based on register, case record
      and interview data in an isolated Finnish birth cohort born 1940-1969.
PG  - 808-16
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia occurs worldwide but the prevalence varies
      markedly. In Finland, schizophrenia is most prevalent in the northeastern
      region. Our aims were to reassess the register-, case record- and
      interview-based lifetime prevalence in a genetically homogeneous birth
      cohort from an isolate population with earlier reported high prevalence of
      schizophrenia and a chromosome linkage to chromosome 1q. METHODS: We
      identified all patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia [International
      Classification of Diseases (ICD)-8, ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes], born 1940-1969
      in the isolate (n=282) and alive (n=237) in 1998 using the Hospital
      Discharge, Disability Pension and Free Medicine Registers. The
      corresponding birth cohort of 14,817 persons and 12,368 alive in 1998 was
      identified from the National Population Register. We validated 69% of the
      register diagnosis by making DSM-IV consensus diagnoses, and interviewed
      131 (55%) of the 237 patients with SCID-I and SCID-II. RESULTS: The
      register-based lifetime prevalence was 1.5% for schizophrenia and 1.9% for
      schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorders: in birth cohorts born 1945 to
      1959, the latter prevalence was especially high (2.4%). Of those with a
      register diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorder, 69% or
      63% also received a record-based consensus diagnosis or SCID interview
      diagnosis of schizophrenia, and the prevalence was 0.9-1.3 and 0.7-1.2%,
      respectively, when we reassessed most of the register-based cases. The
      cumulative incidence of schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorders in the
      total birth cohort was 1.9%. CONCLUSION: In this isolate, the register,
      DSM-IV consensus and SCID interview-based lifetime prevalence of
      schizophrenia was internationally high. For genetic research work, the
      register diagnosis should be reassessed using either structured interview
      or the best estimate consensus diagnosis.

TI  - [Ovarian hyperstimulation induced by a GnRH agonist. About one case].
PG  - 994-7
AB  - We report a case of ovarian hyperstimulation induced by a GnRH agonist
      (Decapeptyl in a patient aged of 23 years and having 3 years of primary
      infertility of male origin. Twelve days after agonist administration,
      several ovarian follicles, great-sized, and with a rate of elevated serum
      oestradiol have been noted. After triggering of the ovulation by 5000 IU
      of HCG, oocyte retrieval permitted the collection of 4 oocytes 3 of which
      were mature. Only one embryo with 4 cells has been transferred 48 hours
      after intracytoplasmic sperm injection fertilization (ICSI), but there was
      no pregnancy. Ovarian hyperstimulation induced by GnRH agonist is a rare
      event and only a few cases have been reported. The development of multiple
      follicles after the administration of an agonist is a paradoxal answer of
      the ovary to the pituitary desensitization without a clarified
      physiopathology. The hypothesis of a direct action of the agonist on the
      ovary is likeliest. Triggering of ovulation by human chorionic
      gonadotrophin (HCG) has been achieved by certain authors. Fertilization of
      oocytes and transfers of embryos have succeeded in certain cases, but only
      one pregnancy has been reported that led to a living birth.

TI  - Effects of growth hormone on the differentiation of mouse B-lymphoid
      precursors.
PG  - 408-16
AB  - Growth hormone (GH) has been known to enhance immune responses directly or
      through insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). The present study aimed to
      clarify the roles of GH in the differentiation of B-lineage precursors. In
      short-term bone marrow cultures, which contained stem cells and early
      B-lineage cells, GH (10 mug/L) treatment for one day decreased the
      percentages of stem cells (0.5-fold) and increased those of B-lineage
      cells (1.4-fold). Furthermore, GH changed the expressions of transcription
      factors for B cell progenitors differentiation such as paired box gene-5
      (Pax-5), immunoglobulin-associated-alpha (Ig-alpha)/CD79a, Ig-beta/CD79b,
      and IGF-I. Thus, a physiological concentration of GH stimulated the
      differentiation of B-lymphoid precursors from bone marrow stem cells.
      Since mRNAs of both GH and GH receptor were present in stem cells and
      B-cell precursors in bone marrow, GH may modulate B-lymphoid precursors
      development in an autocrine or paracrine manner in bone marrows.

TI  - Elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations as a predictor of
      steatohepatitis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
PG  - 1448-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although steatosis is common in patients with severe
      hyperhomocysteinemia due to deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase,
      there are no satisfactory data on homocysteine concentrations in patients
      with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The main aim of the present study
      was to evaluate the clinical significance of plasma homocysteine
      concentrations in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
      METHODS: Seventy-one non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients, 36
      patients with chronic viral hepatitis and 30 healthy persons were enrolled
      in the study. Homocysteine levels were measured by high-performance liquid
      chromatography. Insulin, folate, vitamin B(12) and lipoprotein levels were
      also determined in all groups. RESULTS: Homocysteine in the non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease group was found to be significantly higher than other
      groups. Homocysteine was found to be significantly higher in the
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis group when compared with simple steatosis
      group. A positive correlation was found between homocysteine and
      triglyceride, very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, insulin,
      and index of insulin resistance in the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      group, and a negative correlation was found between homocysteine and
      folate, or vitamin B(12) in all groups. The homocysteine threshold for the
      prediction of steatohepatitis was 11.935 ng/mL. Furthermore; plasma
      homocysteine was a statistically significant predictor for severity of
      necroinflammatory activity in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. CONCLUSIONS:
      The plasma homocysteine concentrations were significantly higher in
      patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, while the concentrations
      were not affected by chronic viral hepatitis. Plasma homocysteine is a
      parameter for discriminating steatohepatitis from simple steatosis.
      Determining the plasma homocysteine concentrations may facilitate
      selection of steatosis patients in whom a liver biopsy should be
      performed.

TI  - Valsartan, an angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker, and left ventricular
      diastolic function--a case report.
PG  - 467-73
AB  - Impaired diastolic function is related to subjective symptoms, reduced
      exercise capacity, and poor prognosis in patients with congestive heart
      failure, and an angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker might have a
      beneficial effect on diastolic function in such patients with heart
      failure. A 53-year-old woman underwent valvuloplasty of the mitral valve
      and later presented with heart failure symptoms, including exertional
      dyspnea and easy fatigue. Although no pathological changes could be
      identified by radiography of the chest, electrocardiography, or routine
      echocardiography, the assessment of diastolic function with Doppler
      echocardiography revealed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Her
      neurohumoral parameters and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction
      improved after 1 month of treatment with Valsartan, an angiotensin II
      type-I receptor blocker, accompanied by improvement of her subjective
      symptoms. This case implies that angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker
      could improve left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and that Doppler
      echocardiography might be useful for detecting diastolic dysfunction in
      high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

TI  - Hierarchy levels, sum score, and worsening of disability are related to
      depressive symptoms in elderly men from three European countries.
PG  - 125-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to investigate the predictive value of
      hierarchy levels and sum score of disability and change in disability on
      depressive symptoms. METHOD: Longitudinal data of 723 men age 70 and older
      from the Finland, Italy, and the Netherlands Elderly Study were collected
      in 1990 and 1995. Self-reported disability was based on three disability
      domains (instrumental activities, mobility, and basic activities) and
      depressive symptoms on the Zung questionnaire. RESULTS: Severity levels of
      disability were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Men with
      no disability scored 5 to 17 points lower (p < .01) on depressive symptoms
      than did those with disability in all domains. Among men with mild
      disability, those who had worsening of disability status in the preceding
      5 years scored 5 points higher (p = .004) on depressive symptoms than did
      men who improved. DISCUSSION: Hierarchic severity levels, sum score of
      disability, and preceding changes in disability status are risk factors
      for depressive symptoms.

TI  - Calcitriol inhibits growth response to Platelet-Derived Growth Factor-BB
      in human prostate cells.
PG  - 189-96
AB  - Calcitriol, a hormonal form of Vitamin D, regulates growth of normal and
      cancer cells of various origins by modulation of peptide growth factors
      signaling. Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) signaling pathway is
      involved in prostate cancer progression. We studied the expression of PDGF
      receptors in human prostate primary stromal cells and cancer epithelial
      cell lines and growth response to PDGF-BB isoform. We found that the
      expression of PDGF receptors and PDGF-BB-mediated cell growth are
      regulated by calcitriol in prostate cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
      revealed a lower level of mRNA for PDGF receptors in LNCaP and PC-3 cells
      than in primary stromal cells. Western blotting showed a high amount of
      PDGFRalpha and beta proteins in primary stromal cells that could not be
      detected in LNCaP, which may explain the resistance of LNCaP cells to
      growth-promoting effect of PDGF-BB. Addition of Epidermal Growth Factor
      (EGF) to the culture medium induces the expression of PDGFRbeta and
      restores responsiveness of LNCaP to PDGF-BB to some extent. Calcitriol
      down-regulates PDGFRbeta expression and negatively regulates PDGF-mediated
      cell growth. Calcitriol does not affect PDGFRalpha and PDGF-B mRNA
      expression. We suggest that inhibition of PDGFRbeta expression by
      calcitriol might reduce responsiveness of prostate cells to mitogenic
      action of PDGF-BB.

TI  - Nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa:
      epidemiology and treatment options.
PG  - 1353-64
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading gram-negative organisms
      associated with nosocomial infections. The increasing frequency of
      multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA) strains is concerning
      as efficacious antimicrobial options are severely limited. By searching
      MEDLINE from January 1966-February 2005 and relevant journals for
      abstracts, we reviewed the frequency, risk factors, and patient outcomes
      of MDRPA nosocomial infections in critically ill patients, determined the
      available antimicrobial therapies, and then provided recommendations for
      clinicians. The definition of MDRPA was established as isolates
      intermediate or resistant to at least three drugs in the following
      classes: beta-lactams, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones.
      Reported rates of MDRPA varied from 0.6-32% according to geographic
      location and type of surveillance study. Risk factors for MDRPA infection
      included prolonged hospitalization, exposure to antimicrobial therapy, and
      immunocompromised states such as human immunodeficiency virus infection.
      Emergence of MDRPA isolates during therapy was reported in 27-72% of
      patients with initially susceptible P. aeruginosa isolates. Patients with
      severe MDRPA infections should be treated with combination therapy,
      consisting of an antipseudomonal beta-lactam with an aminoglycoside or
      fluoroquinolone rather than aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone
      combinations, to provide adequate therapy and improve patient outcomes.
      Synergy has been observed when resistant antipseudomonal drugs were
      combined in vitro against MDRPA with successful clinical application
      reported in two centers. Colistin with adjunctive therapy, such as a
      beta-lactam or rifampin, may be a useful agent in MDRPA when antimicrobial
      options are limited, but patients should be monitored closely for
      toxicities associated with this agent. Standardization of terminology for
      MDRPA isolates is needed for consistency and comparability of surveillance
      and institutional reports. Clinical studies are needed to identify risk
      factors for MDRPA development and to determine the economic impact of
      these infections, as well as to determine the most efficacious
      antimicrobial regimens and duration of therapy to maximize outcomes in the
      treatment of MDRPA infections.

TI  - Plasma soluble osteopontin concentrations are increased in patients with
      rheumatic mitral stenosis and associated with the severity of mitral valve
      calcium.
PG  - 817-20
AB  - Although the severity of valvular calcification is an important prognostic
      indicator, the cellular mechanisms of the calcification process are
      unknown. Osteopontin modulates inflammation and biomineralization, and
      increased osteopontin expression has been demonstrated in calcified
      degenerative or rheumatic cardiac valves. The present study evaluated
      soluble plasma osteopontin in 32 patients with echocardiographically
      determined rheumatic mitral stenosis and compared the results to those of
      a control group of 22 healthy patients. Patients were evaluated with
      routine echocardiographic techniques, Wilkins scoring, and 2-dimensional
      echocardiographic calcium scoring. Patients with rheumatic involvement
      other than in the mitral valve were excluded. Plasma osteopontin and
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in patients with mitral
      stenosis were significantly higher those of the control group (p = 0.006
      and p = 0.0001, respectively). A significant correlation was found between
      plasma osteopontin levels and the severity of mitral valve calcification
      (p = 0.003) and also between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels
      and Wilkins score (p = 0.009). There was a stepwise and statistically
      significant increase in soluble plasma osteopontin levels in association
      with the severity of mitral valve calcification. In conclusion, increased
      osteopontin levels were correlated with the severity of mitral valve
      calcification in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, suggesting an
      important role of osteopontin in the modulation of valvular calcification.
      Elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations
      suggest the presence of ongoing inflammation in those patients.

TI  - Effects of human soluble BAFF synthesized in Escherichia coli on CD4+ and
      CD8+ T lymphocytes as well as NK cells in mice.
PG  - 301-7
AB  - B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF, also called
      BLyS, TALL-1, zTNF-4, or THANK) is an important survival factor for B
      lymphocytes. In this study, we injected mouse abdominal cavity with human
      soluble BAFF (hsBAFF, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 2 mg/kg body mass) synthesized in
      Escherichia coli. On the 8th day after injection, we investigated the
      effects of hsBAFF on immune functional activities of splenic B
      lymphocytes, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells
      in mice. The results showed that B lymphocyte proliferation significantly
      increased in hsBAFF-treated groups with dosages of 0.1 mg/kg (p<0.05), 0.5
      and 2 mg/kg (p<0.01). We observed a dose-dependent increase of CD4(+) T
      lymphocyte percentage and significantly higher values in 0.5 and 2 mg/kg
      hsBAFF-treated groups (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively) compared to
      control group, but CD8(+) T lymphocyte percentage remained unchanged. The
      ratio of CD4(+) to CD8(+) T lymphocytes rose with increasing hsBAFF dosage
      (p<0.05 for 2 mg/kg hsBAFF vs. control). Significantly stronger NK cell
      activities were found in 0.5 and 2 mg/kg hsBAFF-treated groups (p<0.05).
      The main finding of this study is that the hsBAFF can enhance immune
      responses in the body by increasing B lymphocyte and CD4(+) T lymphocyte
      function as well as elevating NK cell activity.

TI  - The effect of Lorenzo's oil on oxidative stress in X-linked
      adrenoleukodystrophy.
PG  - 157-64
AB  - X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder
      biochemically characterized by the accumulation of very long chain fatty
      acids (VLCFA), particularly hexacosanoic acid (C(26:0)) and tetracosanoic
      acid (C(24:0)), in tissues and biological fluids. Although patients
      affected by this disorder predominantly present central and peripheral
      demyelination as well as adrenal insufficiency, the mechanisms underlying
      the brain damage in X-ALD are poorly known. The current treatment of X-ALD
      with glyceroltrioleate (C(18:1))/glyceroltrierucate (C(22:1)) (Lorenzo's
      oil, LO) combined with a VLCFA-poor diet normalizes VLCFA concentrations,
      but the neurological symptoms persist or even progress in symptomatic
      patients. Considering that free radical generation is involved in various
      neurodegenerative disorders and that in a previous study we showed
      evidence that oxidative stress is probably involved in the pathophysiology
      of X-ALD symptomatic patients, in the present study we evaluated various
      oxidative stress parameters, namely thiobarbituric acid reactive species
      (TBA-RS) and total antioxidant reactivity (TAR) in plasma, as well as the
      activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase
      (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in erythrocytes from symptomatic
      and asymptomatic X-ALD patients and verified whether LO treatment and a
      VLCFA restricted diet could change these parameters. We observed a
      significant increase of plasma TBA-RS in symptomatic and asymptomatic
      X-ALD patients, reflecting induction of lipid peroxidation even before the
      disease was manifested. In addition, LO treatment did not alter this
      profile. Furthermore, plasma TAR measurement of X-ALD patients was not
      different from that of controls. Similarly, the antioxidant enzyme
      activities CAT, SOD and GPx were not altered in erythrocyte from X-ALD
      patients as compared to controls. We also examined the in vitro effects of
      hexacosanoic acid (C(26:0)) and tetracosanoic acid (C(24:0)) alone or
      combined with oleic (C(18:1))/erucic (C(22:1)) acids on various oxidative
      stress parameters in cerebral cortex of young rats, namely
      chemiluminescence, TBA-RS, TAR, CAT, SOD and GPx in order to investigate
      whether those fatty acids were able to induce oxidative stress. We found
      that there was a significant increase of TBARS and of chemiluminescence in
      rat cerebral cortex exposed to C(26:0)/C(24:0), and that the addition of
      C(18:1)and C(22:1) to the assays did not prevent this effect. Furthermore,
      TAR measurement was not altered by C(26:0) and C(24:0) acids in rat
      cerebral cortex. Taken together, our results indicate that lipid
      peroxidation occurs in X-ALD and that LO treatment does not attenuate or
      prevent free radical generation in these patients. Therefore, it may be
      presumed that antioxidants should be considered as an adjuvant therapy for
      X-ALD patients.

TI  - Loss of expression of type IV collagen alpha5 and alpha6 chains in
      colorectal cancer associated with the hypermethylation of their promoter
      region.
PG  - 856-65
AB  - Type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membrane (BM), is
      composed of six genetically distinct alpha(IV) chains, alpha1(IV) to
      alpha6(IV). Their genes are paired on three different chromosomes in a
      head-to-head arrangement. The alpha5(IV) gene (COL4A5) and the alpha6(IV)
      gene (COL4A6) are on chromosome Xq22 and are regulated by a bidirectional
      promoter. Loss of the alpha5(IV)/alpha6(IV) chains in epithelial BM occur
      in the early stage of cancer invasion. However, the regulatory mechanism
      of the specific loss of the alpha5(IV)/alpha6(IV) chains during cancer
      cell invasion is still undetermined. In the present study, we examined the
      expression of the alpha5(IV)/alpha6(IV) chains and the methylation
      profiles of the bidirectional promoter region of COL4A5/COL4A6 in colon
      cancer cell lines and colorectal tumor tissues. The expression of the
      alpha5(IV)/alpha6(IV) chains was down-regulated in colorectal cancer, and
      the loss of expression of the alpha5(IV)/alpha6(IV) chains was associated
      with the hypermethylation of their promoter region. In conclusion, the
      hypermethylation of the bidirectional promoter region of COL4A5/COL4A6 is
      one of the events that is responsible for the loss of expression of the
      alpha5(IV)/alpha6(IV) chains and the remodeling of the epithelial BM
      during cancer cell invasion.

TI  - Regional and whole-body markers of nitric oxide production following
      hyperemic stimuli.
PG  - 1164-9
AB  - The measurement of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is of great clinical
      interest in the assessment of vascular health. However, NO is rapidly
      oxidized to form nitrite and nitrate and thus its direct detection in
      biological systems is difficult. Venous plasma nitrite (nM concentrations)
      has been shown to be a marker of forearm NO production following
      pharmacological stimulation of the endothelium utilizing acetylcholine
      (Ach). In the present study, we demonstrate, within 15 apparently healthy
      subjects (34.1 +/- 7.3 years), that reactive hyperemia of the forearm, a
      physiological endothelial stimulus, results in a 52.5% increase in mean
      plasma nitrite concentrations (415 +/- 64.0 to 634 +/- 57.1 nM, P =
      0.015). However, plasma nitrite is readily oxidized to nitrate within
      plasma, and thus its utility as a marker of NO production within the
      clinical setting may be limited. Alternatively, NOx (predominantly
      nitrate) is relatively stable in plasma (microM concentrations), but is
      produced by sources other than the vasculature and has been shown to be
      unsuitable as a measure of localized NO production. We reasoned that the
      principle source of NOx generation during exercise is NO production and
      thus have examined the change in NOx following treadmill exercise stress.
      In this study, 12 apparently healthy subjects showed an increase (from
      baseline) in venous NOx at peak effort and during recovery (12 +/- 9.1 and
      17 +/- 15.3 microM respectively, P < 0.05). In contrast, 10 subjects with
      cardiovascular disease showed no significant increases. Additionally, a
      correlation between VO(2peak) and the change in circulating NOx (r(2) =
      0.4585, P < or = 0.01) indicated the subjects who could exercise hardest
      also produced the most NO.

TI  - CT pulmonary angiography is the first-line imaging test for acute
      pulmonary embolism: a survey of US clinicians.
PG  - 434-46
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to document current imaging practices
      for diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism (PE) among physicians practicing
      in the United States and explore factors associated with these practices.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 2004 and February 2005, we
      surveyed by mail 855 physicians selected at random from membership lists
      of three professional organizations. Physicians reported their imaging
      practices and experiences in managing patients with suspected acute PE
      during the preceding 12 months. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were
      received from 240 of 806 eligible participants (29.8%) practicing in 44
      states: 86.7% of respondents believed that computed tomographic pulmonary
      angiography (CTPA) was the most useful imaging procedure for patients with
      acute PE compared with 8.3% for ventilation-perfusion (V-P) scintigraphy
      and 2.5% for conventional pulminary angiography (PA). After chest
      radiography, CTPA was the first imaging test requested 71.4% of the time
      compared with V-P scintigraphy (19.7%) and lower-limb venous ultrasound
      (5.8%). Participants received indeterminate or inconclusive results 46.4%
      of the time for V-P scintigraphy, 10.6% of the time for CTPA, and 2.2% of
      the time for PA. CTPA was available around the clock to 88.3% of
      participants compared with 53.8% for V-P scintigraphy and 42.5% for PA. A
      total of 68.6% of respondents received CTPA results in 2 hours or less (vs
      37.5% for V-P scintigraphy and 22.9% for PA). CTPA also provided an
      alternative diagnosis to PE or showed other significant abnormalities
      28.5% of the time, and these findings frequently altered management.
      CONCLUSION: US clinicians unequivocally prefer CTPA in patients with
      suspected acute PE. Reasons for this preference include availability and
      timely reporting, a lower rate of inconclusive results, and the additional
      diagnostic capabilities that CTPA can provide.

TI  - Comparative linkage mapping of the Grey coat colour gene in horses.
PG  - 390-5
AB  - Grey horses are born coloured, turn progressively grey and often develop
      melanomas late in life. Grey shows an autosomal dominant inheritance and
      the locus has previously been mapped to horse chromosome 25 (ECA25),
      around the TXN gene. We have now developed eight new single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with genes on ECA25 using information on
      the linear order of genes on human chromosome 9q, as well as the human and
      mouse coding sequences. These SNPs were mapped in relation to the Grey
      locus using more than 300 progeny from matings between two Swedish
      Warmblood grey stallions and non-grey mares. Grey was firmly assigned to
      an interval with flanking markers NANS and ABCA1. This corresponds to a
      region of approximately 6.9 Mb on human chromosome 9q. Furthermore, no
      recombination was observed between Grey, TGFBR1 and TMEFF1, the last two
      being 1.4 Mb apart in human. There are no obvious candidate genes in this
      region and none of the genes has been associated with pigmentation
      disorders or melanoma development, suggesting that the grey phenotype is
      caused by a mutation in a novel gene.

TI  - Mucosally-directed adrenergic nerves and sympathomimetic drugs enhance
      non-intimate adherence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to porcine cecum and
      colon.
PG  - 116-24
AB  - The sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine has been found to increase
      mucosal adherence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in
      explants of murine cecum and porcine distal colon. In the present study,
      we tested the hypothesis that norepinephrine augments the initial, loose
      adherence of this important pathogen to the intestinal mucosa. In mucosal
      sheets of porcine cecum or proximal, spiral and distal colon mounted in
      Ussing chambers, norepinephrine (10 microM, contraluminal addition)
      increased mucosal adherence of wild-type E. coli O157:H7 strain 85-170; in
      the cecal mucosa, this effect occurred within 30-90 min after bacterial
      inoculation. In addition, norepinephrine transiently increased
      short-circuit current in cecal and colonic mucosal sheets, a measure of
      active anion transport. Norepinephrine was effective in promoting cecal
      adherence of a non-O157 E. coli strain as well as E. coli O157:H7 eae or
      espA mutant strains that are incapable of intimate mucosal attachment.
      Nerve fibers immunoreactive for the norepinephrine synthetic enzyme
      dopamine beta-hydroxylase appeared in close proximity to the cecal
      epithelium, and the norepinephrine reuptake blocker cocaine, like
      norepinephrine and the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist UK-14,304,
      increased E. coli O157:H7 adherence. These results suggest that
      norepinephrine, acting upon the large bowel mucosa, modulates early,
      non-intimate adherence of E. coli O157:H7 and probably other
      mucosa-associated bacteria. Sympathetic nerves innervating the cecocolonic
      mucosa may link acute stress exposure or psychostimulant abuse with an
      increased microbial colonization of the intestinal surface. This in turn
      may alter host susceptibility to enteric infections.

TI  - Factors related to renal dysfunction in patients with anorexia nervosa.
PG  - 73-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anorexia nervosa (AN) patients were surveyed to determine which
      disease factors were related to AN influenced renal dysfunction. METHODS:
      Data were from forty-five AN patients hospitalized in our department
      between 1995 and 2002. The patients were classified into three groups
      based on the type of anorexia: restricting (n=18), self-induced vomiting
      (n=13), and laxative abuse (n=14). Twenty-four hour-creatinine clearance
      (Ccr) was calculated within two weeks of hospitalization for comparison
      among the three groups. RESULTS: The Ccr level of the laxative abuse group
      was significantly lower than that of the restricting group (65.8+/-31.4
      ml/min vs restricting type: 104+/-23.3 ml/min, p=0.002). The laxative
      abuse group had a significantly longer duration of illness than the
      restricting group (p<0.0001). Multiple regression analysis revealed the
      duration of illness to be a risk factor for renal function deterioration
      in AN patients (r=0.580, p<0.001). DISCUSSION: Renal function should be
      carefully followed during the treatment of AN patients with a long
      duration of illness, especially those with long-term laxative abuse.

TI  - Depletion of Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp7 and Spemann organizer signals induces
      massive brain formation in Xenopus embryos.
PG  - 3381-92
AB  - To address the patterning function of the Bmp2, Bmp4 and Bmp7 growth
      factors, we designed antisense morpholino oligomers (MO) that block their
      activity in Xenopus laevis. Bmp4 knockdown was sufficient to rescue the
      ventralizing effects caused by loss of Chordin activity. Double Bmp4 and
      Bmp7 knockdown inhibited tail development. Triple Bmp2/Bmp4/Bmp7 depletion
      further compromised trunk development but did not eliminate dorsoventral
      patterning. Unexpectedly, we found that blocking Spemann organizer
      formation by UV treatment or beta-Catenin depletion caused BMP inhibition
      to have much more potent effects, abolishing all ventral development and
      resulting in embryos having radial central nervous system (CNS)
      structures. Surprisingly, dorsal signaling molecules such as Chordin,
      Noggin, Xnr6 and Cerberus were not re-expressed in these embryos. We
      conclude that BMP inhibition is sufficient for neural induction in vivo,
      and that in the absence of ventral BMPs, Spemann organizer signals are not
      required for brain formation.

TI  - Model-based image reconstruction for four-dimensional PET.
PG  - 1288-98
AB  - Positron emission tonography (PET) is useful in diagnosis and radiation
      treatment planning for a variety of cancers. For patients with cancers in
      thoracic or upper abdominal region, the respiratory motion produces large
      distortions in the tumor shape and size, affecting the accuracy in both
      diagnosis and treatment. Four-dimensional (4D) (gated) PET aims to reduce
      the motion artifacts and to provide accurate measurement of the tumor
      volume and the tracer concentration. A major issue in 4D PET is the lack
      of statistics. Since the collected photons are divided into several frames
      in the 4D PET scan, the quality of each reconstructed frame degrades as
      the number of frames increases. The increased noise in each frame heavily
      degrades the quantitative accuracy of the PET imaging. In this work, we
      propose a method to enhance the performance of 4D PET by developing a new
      technique of 4D PET reconstruction with incorporation of an organ motion
      model derived from 4D-CT images. The method is based on the well-known
      maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) algorithm. During the
      processes of forward- and backward-projection in the ML-EM iterations, all
      projection data acquired at different phases are combined together to
      update the emission map with the aid of deformable model, the statistics
      is therefore greatly improved. The proposed algorithm was first evaluated
      with computer simulations using a mathematical dynamic phantom. Experiment
      with a moving physical phantom was then carried out to demonstrate the
      accuracy of the proposed method and the increase of signal-to-noise ratio
      over three-dimensional PET. Finally, the 4D PET reconstruction was applied
      to a patient case.

TI  - ABA-hypersensitive germination3 encodes a protein phosphatase 2C (AtPP2CA)
      that strongly regulates abscisic acid signaling during germination among
      Arabidopsis protein phosphatase 2Cs.
PG  - 115-26
AB  - The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates physiologically important
      developmental processes and stress responses. Previously, we reported on
      Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) L. Heynh. ahg mutants, which are
      hypersensitive to ABA during germination and early growth. Among them,
      ABA-hypersensitive germination3 (ahg3) showed the strongest ABA
      hypersensitivity. In this study, we found that the AHG3 gene is identical
      to AtPP2CA, which encodes a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C). Although
      AtPP2CA has been reported to be involved in the ABA response on the basis
      of results obtained by reverse-genetics approaches, its physiological
      relevance in the ABA response has not been clarified yet. We demonstrate
      in vitro and in vivo that the ahg3-1 missense mutation causes the loss of
      PP2C activity, providing concrete confirmation that this PP2C functions as
      a negative regulator in ABA signaling. Furthermore, we compared the
      effects of disruption mutations of eight structurally related PP2C genes
      of Arabidopsis, including ABI1, ABI2, HAB1, and HAB2, and found that the
      disruptant mutant of AHG3/AtPP2CA had the strongest ABA hypersensitivity
      during germination, but it did not display any significant phenotypes in
      adult plants. Northern-blot analysis clearly showed that AHG3/AtPP2CA is
      the most active among those PP2C genes in seeds. These results suggest
      that AHG3/AtPP2CA plays a major role among PP2Cs in the ABA response in
      seeds and that the functions of those PP2Cs overlap, but their unique
      tissue- or development-specific expression confers distinct and
      indispensable physiological functions in the ABA response.

TI  - Effects of self-fertilization, environmental stress and exposure to
      xenobiotics on fitness-related traits of the freshwater snail Lymnaea
      stagnalis.
PG  - 199-213
AB  - Genetic and ecological factors may interact in their effects on fitness.
      Such interactions are thus to be expected between inbreeding and exposure
      of a population to a toxicant. The magnitude of inbreeding depression is
      thought to increase in stressful environments. To test this hypothesis, we
      investigated the combined effects of environmental conditions and
      inbreeding on fitness in the self-fertile snail Lymnaea stagnalis, using a
      stress gradient (0-2) applied to a 100 isolated and paired lineages:
      laboratory control (0), outdoor microcosm control (1) and pesticide
      exposure under outdoor microcosm conditions (2). Outdoor stress conditions
      were maintained for 28 days prior to measurements of fitness traits
      (fecundity, hatching success, and size at hatching) under laboratory
      conditions, so that delayed environmental effects could be estimated.
      Under laboratory control conditions, we found significant initial family
      level heterogeneity for most measured traits, including physiological
      performances as assessed through energetic biomarkers. Whatever the
      environmental conditions, inbreeding depression was very low for progeny
      performances. Negative values of self-fertilization depression (SFD) were
      obtained. Unexpectedly, SFD showed a negative relationship with the
      assumed stress intensity, reflecting a higher sensitivity under pairing
      than under selfing, mostly due to parental fecundity. This suggests that
      stressful conditions may favour selfing. Stress intensity increased the
      distribution limits of both depression indices, suggesting that changes in
      fitness are less predictable in a population under stress. Implications of
      such findings for environmental risk assessment of pesticides are
      discussed.

TI  - The mechanism of HIV-1 core assembly: insights from three-dimensional
      reconstructions of authentic virions.
PG  - 15-20
AB  - Infectious HIV particles contain a characteristic cone-shaped core
      encasing the viral RNA and replication proteins. The core exhibits
      significant heterogeneity in size and shape, yet consistently forms a
      well-defined structure. The mechanism by which the core is assembled in
      the maturing virion remains poorly understood. Using cryo-electron
      tomography, we have produced three-dimensional reconstructions of
      authentic, unstained HIV-1. These reveal the viral morphology with
      unprecedented clarity and suggest the following mechanism for core
      formation inside the extracellular virion: core growth initiates at the
      narrow end of the cone and proceeds toward the distal side of the virion
      until limited by the viral membrane. Curvature and closure of the broad
      end of the core are then directed by the inner surface of the viral
      membrane. This mechanism accommodates significant flexibility in lattice
      growth while ensuring the closure of cores of variable size and shape.

TI  - Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) for liver metastases secondary
      to colorectal adenocarcinoma.
PG  - S62-73
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is a relatively
      new commercially available microbrachytherapy technique for treatment of
      malignant hepatic lesions using (90)Y embedded in resin microspheres,
      which are infused directly into the hepatic arterial circulation. It is
      FDA approved for liver metastases secondary to colorectal carcinoma and is
      under investigation for treatment of other liver malignancies, such as
      hepatocellular carcinoma and neuroendocrine malignancies.
      MATERIALS/METHODS: A modest number of clinical trials, preclinical animal
      studies, and dosimetric studies have been reported. Here we review several
      of the more important results. RESULTS: High doses of beta radiation can
      be selectively delivered to tumors, resulting in impressive local control
      and survival rates. Ex vivo analyses have shown that microspheres
      preferentially cluster around the periphery of tumor nodules with a high
      tumor:normal tissue ratio of up to 200:1. Toxicity is usually mild,
      featuring fatigue, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and slight
      elevations of liver function tests. CONCLUSIONS: Selective internal
      radiation therapy represents an effective means of controlling liver
      metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma. Clinical trials have
      demonstrated improved local control of disease and survival with
      relatively low toxicity. Investigations of SIRT for other hepatic
      malignancies and in combination with newer chemotherapy agents and
      targeted biologic therapies are under way or in planning. A
      well-integrated team involving interventional radiology, nuclear medicine,
      medical oncology, surgical oncology, medical physics, and radiation
      oncology is essential for a successful program. Careful selection of
      patients through the combined expertise of the team can maximize
      therapeutic efficacy and reduce the potential for adverse effects.

TI  - The safety of thiamethoxam to pollinating bumble bees (Bombus terrestris
      L.) when applied to tomato plants through drip irrigation.
PG  - 569-79
AB  - Thiamethoxam, mainly sold under the trademark of Actara, is a
      neonicotinoid widely used in covered vegetables for the control of aphids
      and whiteflies. In these crops, and particularly in covered tomatoes,
      bumble-bees are used for cross-pollination as an alternative to labour
      intensive manual techniques. In this study, made on tomatoes grown in
      separated greenhouse plots in Murcia, Southern Spain, thiamethoxam was
      applied through drip irrigation at a rate of 200 g ai/ha, and as a split
      application of the same rate, to evaluate the effects on pollinating
      bumble bees compared to a foliar application of a toxic standard. The
      results showed that the toxic foliar standard had a clear effect on the
      pollination of tomato flowers, declining to zero pollination two weeks
      after application, whereas both the single and split drip irrigation
      applications of Actara had no effect on pollination when compared to the
      control plots. The count of dead adults and larvae did not show any
      differences between the treatments, whereas the measurement of sugar water
      consumption was shown to correlate well with pollination. The consumption
      of sugar water declined in the toxic standard plots by 69% with respect to
      the control, whilst the decline in lower dose drip irrigation application
      was only 3%. In regard to hive weight, and number of adults and brood
      after destructive sampling; there were no statistical differences between
      the treatments but a negative effect of the foliar treatment was observed.
      Based on these results we can conclude that a split application of Actara
      applied in drip irrigation to the soil/substrate has no effect on the
      bumble-bees used in tomatoes for pollination.

TI  - Sex hormone concentrations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are not
      normalized during 12 weeks of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.
PG  - 1253-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and
      testosterone are markedly lower in postmenopausal women with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) than in controls. In contrast, compared to controls, serum
      levels of estrogens are normal or elevated in women with RA. Since tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) alters production of these hormones, we investigated
      changes of these hormones during anti-TNF antibody (anti-TNF) therapy with
      adalimumab in longstanding RA. METHODS: In this longitudinal anti-TNF
      therapy study in 13 patients with long-standing RA without prior
      prednisolone (7 infusions of anti-TNF: Week 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12), we
      measured serum concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), androstenedione,
      DHEA, DHEAS, free testosterone, estrone, and 17ss-estradiol. Levels of
      these hormones in patients were compared to serum levels of 31 age and sex
      matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Upon treatment with anti-TNF, there was
      an impressive decrease of clinical markers of inflammation, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, and serum levels of IL-6. Serum levels of DHEAS and
      free testosterone were markedly lower at baseline in patients compared to
      controls, but this did not change during anti-TNF therapy. Serum levels of
      DHEA and 17ss-estradiol were significantly elevated in patients compared
      to controls, but similarly, anti-TNF therapy did not change initially
      increased levels. Molar ratios of hormones, which reflect hormone shifts
      via converting enzymes, showed typical alterations at baseline, but did
      not change markedly during anti-TNF therapy. CONCLUSION: Longterm therapy
      with anti-TNF did not change altered serum levels of typical sex hormones
      in patients with RA, although baseline values were largely different. In
      patients with RA, this indicates that alterations of sex hormones and
      altered activity of respective converting enzymes are imprinted for a
      long-lasting period over at least 12 weeks.

TI  - Correlation of PET standard uptake value and CT window-level thresholds
      for target delineation in CT-based radiation treatment planning.
PG  - 720-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop standardized correlates of
      [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)
      standard uptake value (SUV) to computed tomography (CT)-based window and
      levels. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients with non-small-cell lung
      cancer who underwent imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and
      CT were selected. A method of standardizing SUV within CT planning
      software was developed. A scale factor, determined by a sensitivity
      calibration of the PET scanner, converts voxel counts to activity per gram
      in tissue, allowing SUVs to be correlated to CT window and levels. A
      method of limiting interobserver variations was devised to enhance "edges"
      of regions of interest based on SUV thresholds. The difference in gross
      tumor volumes (GTVs) based on CT, PET SUV >or= 2.5, and regions of 40%
      maximum SUV were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean SUV was 9.3. Mean GTV volumes
      were 253 cc for CT, 221 cc for SUV >or= 2.5, and 97 cc for SUV40%Max.
      Average volume difference was -259% between >or=2.5 SUV and CT and -162%
      between SUV40%Max and CT. Percent difference between GTV >or= 2.5 SUV and
      SUV40%Max remained constant beyond SUV > 7. For SUVs 4-6, best correlation
      among SUV thresholds occurred at volumes near 90 cc. Mean percent change
      from GTVs contoured according to CT (GTV CT) was -260% for GTV2.5 and
      -162% for GTV40%Max. Using the SUV40%Max threshold resulted in a
      significant alteration of volume in 98% of patients, while the SUV2.5
      threshold resulted in an alteration of volume in 58% of patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our method of correlating SUV to W/L thresholds permits
      accurate displaying of SUV in coregistered PET/CT studies. The optimal SUV
      thresholds to contour GTV depend on maximum tumor SUV and volume. Best
      correlation occurs with SUVs >6 and small volumes <100 cc. At SUVs >7,
      differences between the SUV threshold filters remain constant. Because of
      variability in volumes obtained by using SUV40%Max, we recommend using SUV
      >or= 2.5 for radiotherapy planning in non-small-cell lung cancer.

TI  - Predictive factors of cardiac events after implantation of
      sirolimus-eluting stents for treatment of in-stent restenosis.
PG  - 207-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The factors associated with recurrent restenosis after SES
      implantation for in-stent restenosis are unknown. This study aimed to
      assess the clinical outcome and to analyse predictive factors of cardiac
      events in patients with in-stent restenosis treated with Sirolimus-eluting
      stent (SES). METHODS: In 3 centers, consecutive patients (n = 100) with
      elective indication to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for
      in-stent restenosis (n = 110) were treated with SES: 28 lesions were
      focal, 40 diffuse, 17 proliferative, and 15 showed total occlusion.
      RESULTS: SES implantation was successful in all patients, without
      complication during the first hospital stay. The mean follow-up was 15
      (10-24) months. A cardiac event related to the target vessel occurred in
      24 (24%) patients, and was associated with dialysis status (p < 0.05),
      lower ejection fraction (p < 0.05) and revascularization without SES in
      another site (p < 0.0001). A cardiac event related to the SES occurred in
      11 (11%) patients, secondary to an acute or sub-acute thrombosis of the
      SES (2%), to a late occlusion of the target vessel (4%) or to a
      non-occlusive restenosis of the SES (5%), and was associated with unstable
      angina (p < 0.01), multivessel disease (p < 0.03) and revascularization
      without SES in another site (p < 0.03). No cardiac event related to the
      SES occurred in patients with direct stenting. Target lesion
      revascularization for in-SES restenosis or occlusion of the target vessel
      was performed in 7 (7%) patients, and was associated with unstable angina
      (p < 0.01) and revascularization without SES in another site (p < 0.01).
      Target vessel revascularization was needed in 20 patients (20%), related
      to dialysis status (p < 0.01) and a revascularization without SES in
      another site (p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: SESs are effective in the treatment
      of high risk patients with complex in-stent restenosis. Most of cardiac
      events during follow-up are related to a revascularization without SES in
      another site.

TI  - Composition, microstructure, and surface barrier layer development during
      brine salting.
PG  - 2329-40
AB  - The goal of this study was to characterize the changes in chemical
      composition, porosity, and structure that occur at the surface of a block
      of brine-salted cheese and their relationship to the rate at which salt is
      taken up from the brine. To create a difference in composition, salt
      uptake, and barrier layer properties, identical blocks of Ragusano cheese
      were placed in saturated and 18% salt brine at 18 degrees C for 12 d. The
      overall moisture content and porosity decreased, whereas salt and salt in
      moisture content increased near the surface of blocks of brine-salted
      Ragusano cheese for all treatments. The general appearance of the
      microstructure of the surface of the blocks of brine-salted cheese was
      much more compact than the microstructure 1 mm inside the block at both
      brine concentrations. Large differences in porosity of the barrier layer
      were produced by brine-salting cheese in 18% vs. saturated brine, with
      cheese in saturated brine having much lower porosity at the surface and
      taking up much less salt during brining. The macro network of water
      channels within the microstructure of the cheese was less open near the
      surface of the block for cheese in both saturated and 18% brine after 4 d.
      However, no large differences in the size of the macro channels in the
      cheese structure due to the difference in brine concentration were
      observed by scanning electron microscopy. It is possible that the
      shrinkage of the much smaller pore structure within the casein matrix of
      the cheese is more important and will become more limiting to the rate of
      salt diffusion. Further microstructure work at higher resolution is needed
      to answer this question. The calculated decrease in porosity at the
      exterior 1-mm portion of the block was 50.8 and 29.2% for cheeses that had
      been in saturated vs. 18% brine for 12 d, respectively. The difference in
      brine concentration had a very large impact on the salt in moisture
      content of the cheese. The exterior of the cheese in 18% brine reached a
      salt in moisture content almost identical to that of the brine very
      quickly (17.3% at 4 d), whereas the salt in moisture content at the
      surface of the cheese block in saturated brine was only 11.9% at 4 d.
      There appears to be some critical concentration of salt in brine above
      which there is a large negative impact on salt uptake due to the creation
      of a barrier layer at the surface of the block of cheese.

TI  - Promoters and their regulation in Ustilago maydis and other
      phytopathogenic fungi.
PG  - 208-16
AB  - The lifestyle of phytopathogenic fungi is strongly determined by their
      environment. This implies that mechanisms providing for versatile gene
      regulation in response to external signals or during host associations
      exist. In Ustilago maydis, central players of pathogenic development are
      the high mobility group box protein Prf1 that binds to the pheromone
      response element and the homeodomain transcription factor b, which
      recognizes an hsg-like consensus motif known from yeast Mata1-Matalpha2
      DNA binding. Transcription of prf1 is influenced by multiple inputs and
      this is reflected by its modular promoter structure. Analysis of the U.
      maydis mig promoters provides a link to transcriptional regulation during
      biotrophic growth. Furthermore, recognition of repeated GATA sequences as
      well as of triplet motifs by transcription factors with binuclear
      Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) DNA-binding domains appears to mediate diverse
      transcriptional responses relevant for phytopathogenic fungi. Although
      present studies shed some light on the complexity of transcriptional
      processes operating in phytopathogenic fungi, further investigation of
      promoter structures including the involvement of ubiquitous promoter
      elements is needed. Confronted with increasing genome-wide analysis,
      knowledge of promoter structures not only allows predicting
      transcriptional regulation, but might also advance our understanding of
      transcriptional networks.

TI  - Risk factors for participation restriction in leprosy and development of a
      screening tool to identify individuals at risk.
PG  - 305-15
AB  - The World Health Organisation International Classification of Functioning,
      Disability and Health defines participation as involvement in a life
      situation. Participation restrictions are problems experienced in any life
      situation, for example, in relationships or in employment. Our research
      explored risk factors for participation restrictions experienced by people
      affected by leprosy. Our objective was to develop a screening tool to
      identify individuals at risk. An initial round of qualitative fieldwork in
      eight centres in Nepal, India and Brazil identified 35 potential risk
      factors for participation restriction. These were then further assessed
      through quantitative fieldwork in six centres in India and Brazil. In all,
      264 individuals receiving leprosy treatment or rehabilitation services
      made a retrospective assessment of their status at time of diagnosis.
      Their level of participation restriction was assessed using the
      Participation Scale. Regression analysis identified risk factors for
      participation restriction including fear of abandonment by family members
      (odds ratio 2.63, 95% CI 1.35-5.13) and hospitalization at diagnosis
      (3.98, 1.0-7.32). We recommend four consolidated items as the basis for a
      simple screening tool to identify individuals at risk. These are the
      physical impact of leprosy, an emotional response to the diagnosis, female
      gender and having little or no education. Such a tool may form the basis
      for a screening and referral procedure to identify newly diagnosed
      individuals at risk of participation restrictions and in need of actions
      that may prevent such restrictions.

TI  - PAR-1 activation on human late endothelial progenitor cells enhances
      angiogenesis in vitro with upregulation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 system.
PG  - 2321-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The importance of PAR-1 in blood vessel development has been
      demonstrated in knockout mice. As endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are
      involved in postnatal vasculogenesis, we examined whether they express
      PAR-1 and whether stimulation by the peptide SFLLRN modulates their
      angiogenic properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: EPC expanded from human CD34+
      cord blood cells expressed PAR-1. PAR-1 activation induced EPC
      proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner far more potently than
      that of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. PAR-1 activation also
      enhanced actin reorganization, promoting both spontaneous migration in a
      Boyden chamber assay and migration toward SDF-1 and VEGF. As shown by
      real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR), EPC stimulation by SFLLRN significantly enhanced the mRNA
      expression of SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR-4. PAR-1 activation also
      increased CXCR4 expression on EPC and induced SDF-1 secretion, leading to
      autocrine stimulation. PAR-1 stimulation by SFLLRN also increased the
      formation of capillary-like structures by EPC in Matrigel, and this effect
      was abrogated by anti-CXCR-4, anti-SDF-1, and MEK inhibitor pretreatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Human EPCs express functional PAR-1. PAR-1 activation
      promotes cell proliferation and CXCR4-dependent migration and
      differentiation, leading to a proangiogenic effect.

TI  - The novel cytochrome c6 of chloroplasts: a case of evolutionary bricolage?
PG  - 13-22
AB  - Cytochrome c6 has long been known as a redox carrier of the thylakoid
      lumen of cyanobacteria and some eukaryotic algae that can substitute for
      plastocyanin in electron transfer. Until recently, it was widely accepted
      that land plants lack a cytochrome c6. However, a homologue of the protein
      has now been identified in several plant species together with an
      additional isoform in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This form
      of the protein, designated cytochrome c6A, differs from the 'conventional'
      cytochrome c6 in possessing a conserved insertion of 12 amino acids that
      includes two absolutely conserved cysteine residues. There are conflicting
      reports of whether cytochrome c6A can substitute for plastocyanin in
      photosynthetic electron transfer. The evidence for and against this is
      reviewed and the likely evolutionary history of cytochrome c6A is
      discussed. It is suggested that it has been converted from a primary role
      in electron transfer to one in regulation within the chloroplast, and is
      an example of evolutionary 'bricolage'.

TI  - Structural and immunocytochemical characterization of the Ginkgo biloba L.
      sperm motility apparatus.
PG  - 165-73
AB  - Ginkgo biloba and the cycads are the only extant seed plants with motile
      sperm cells. However, there has been no immunocytochemical
      characterization of these gametes to determine if they share
      characteristics with the flagellated sperm found in bryophytes and
      pteridophytes or might give clues as to the relationships to
      nonflagellated sperm in all other seed plants. To determine
      characteristics of proteins associated with the motility apparatus in
      these motile sperm, we probed thin sections of developing spermatogenous
      cells of Ginkgo biloba with antibodies to acetylated and tyrosinated
      tubulin and monoclonal antibodies that recognize mammalian centrosomes and
      centrin. The blepharoplast that occurs as a precursor to the motility
      apparatus consists of an amorphous core, pitted with cavities containing
      microtubules and a surface studded with probasal bodies. The probasal
      bodies and microtubules within the blepharoplast cavities are labeled with
      antibodies specific to acetylated tubulin. Positive but weak reactions of
      the blepharoplast core occur with the centrosomereactive antibodies MPM-2
      and C-9. Reactions to centrin antibodies are negative at this
      developmental stage. From this pre-motility apparatus structure, an
      assemblage of about 1,000 flagella and associated structures arises as the
      precursor to the motility apparatus for the sperm. The flagellar apparatus
      consists of a three-layered multilayered structure that subtends a layer
      of spline microtubules, a zone of amorphous material similar to that in
      the blepharoplast, and the flagellar band. Centrin antibodies react
      strongly with the multilayered structure, the transition zone of the
      flagella, and fibrillar material near the flagellar base at the surface of
      the amorphous material. Both the spline microtubules and all of the
      tubules in the flagella react strongly with the antibodies to acetylated
      tubulin. These localizations are consistent with the localizations of
      these components in pteridophyte and bryophyte spermatogenous cells,
      although the blepharoplast material surrounding and connecting flagellar
      bases does not occur in the seedless (nonseed) land plants. These data
      indicate that despite the large size of ginkgo gametes and the taxonomic
      separation between pteridophytes and Ginkgo biloba, similar proteins in
      gametes of both groups perform similar functions and are therefore
      homologous among these plants. Moreover, the presence of acetylated
      tubulin in bands of microtubules may be a characteristic shared with more
      derived non-flagellated sperm of other conifers and angiosperms.

TI  - Infective endocarditis: experience of a paediatric emergency department.
PG  - 269-72
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical features at presentation of children
      with infective endocarditis to a tertiary centre and review the role of
      the emergency department in these cases. The subsequent course and
      outcomes are briefly discussed. METHODS: Retrospective audit of children
      with endocarditis presenting to a tertiary children's hospital over a
      16-year period. RESULTS: Twenty-three cases of infective endocarditis were
      identified. Initial presentation via the paediatric emergency department
      occurred in 78% of cases and was associated with the least delay to
      commencement of appropriate treatment. The average duration of illness at
      the time of presentation was 6 days. Prior medical care had been sought in
      65% of the cases, with antibiotics prescribed for an alternate diagnosis
      in 73%. Children with and without cardiac anomalies were equally
      represented. Of the group with normal cardiac anatomy, 45% presented
      without a murmur. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent causative
      organism (43%) and accounted for 64% of cases in children with no
      pre-existing cardiac abnormalities. Permanent sequelae were more likely to
      occur with S. aureus. The overall mortality rate was 9%. CONCLUSIONS:
      Infective endocarditis is a rare illness in children and represents a
      diagnostic challenge. The majority of cases will present via the
      paediatric emergency department with a non-specific febrile illness,
      having frequently commenced antibiotics for an alternate diagnosis.
      Specific expertise in paediatric emergency care can assist in early
      diagnosis and management. Morbidity remains significant, particularly in
      cases caused by S. aureus.

TI  - Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibits death receptor-mediated apoptosis and
      promotes invasive growth of HNSCC.
PG  - 679-87
AB  - The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays a critical role in cell
      proliferation and oncogenesis. It has been found to be chronically
      activated in a variety of human cancers, including head and neck squamous
      cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Previously, we have found that the activation of
      the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway inhibits mitochondria-mediated
      apoptosis. In this study, we extended our studies to determine whether the
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway inhibited death receptor-mediated
      apoptosis in HNSCC cells. We found that Wnt/beta-catenin inhibited not
      only tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/c-Myc-mediated apoptosis, but also cell
      detachment-mediated apoptosis (anoikis) which is dependent on the death
      receptor signaling pathway. Interestingly, we also observed that the
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway induced HNSCC cell scattering and
      promoted cell invasion in the Matrigel, both of which are hallmarks for
      the invasive growth of HNSCC. Consistently, the over-expression of
      beta-catenin promoted HNSCC tumor growth in nude mice. Taken together, our
      results suggest that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays dual
      functions in HNSCC development: promoting both cell survival and invasive
      growth of HNSCC cells.

TI  - [Impact of hydrogen sulfide donor on pulmonary vascular structure and
      vasoactive peptides in rats with pulmonary hypertension induced by high
      pulmonary blood flow].
PG  - 159-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor, sodium
      hydrosulfide (NaHS), on pulmonary vascular structure and vasoactive
      peptides in rats with pulmonary hypertension induced by high pulmonary
      blood flow. METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats, weighing 120-140 g, were
      randomly divided into shunt group (n=8), shunt + NaHS group (n=8), sham
      group (n=8), and sham + NaHS group (n=8). Rats in shunt group and shunt +
      NaHS group were subjected to an abdominal aorta-inferior vena cava shunt
      to create an animal model of high pulmonary flow. In the sham group and
      sham + NaHS group, rats experienced the same experimental processes except
      the shunting procedure. Rats in shunt + NaHS group and sham + NaHS group
      were intraperitoneally injected with an exogenous H2S donor--NaHS, at a
      dose of 56 micromol/(kg x d). Meanwhile, rats in shunt group and sham
      group were injected with the same volume of physiological saline. After 11
      weeks of experiment, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) of each rat
      was evaluated by using a right cardiac catheterization procedure. Heart
      tissues were separated as right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular plus
      septum (LV + SP), and the ratio of RV to LV + SP [RV/(LV + SP)] was
      calculated. The morphologic changes including micro-and ultra-structural
      changes of pulmonary arteries of rats were observed under optical
      microscope and electro-microscope, respectively. The percentage of
      muscular artery (MA) in small pulmonary arteries was calculated. The
      change of relative medial thickness (RMT) of pulmonary arteries was
      examined. H2S concentration in plasma was evaluated by modified sulfide
      electrode method. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),
      calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), and proadrenomedullin peptide
      (PAMP) were calculated by radioimmunoassay kit. RESULTS: After 11 weeks of
      shunt, compared with sham group, SPAP increased by 48.63% (P < 0.01 ) and
      RV/ (LV + SP) increased by 21.95% (P < 0.01). Plasma H2S decreased
      significantly (P < 0.01). The percentage of MA increased significantly (P
      < 0.01); RMT increased significantly (P < 0.01). The changes of
      ultra-structure of pulmonary arteries showed that endothelial cells became
      swollen and desquamation, internal elastic lamina became irregular, and
      smooth muscular cells increased in size, showing synthetic phenotype.
      After the rats with shunt was administered with NaHS for 11 weeks, plasma
      H2S increased significantly (P < 0.01). SPAP decreased by 19.82% and
      RV/(LV + SP) decreased by 7.31% (P < 0.01). The percentage of MA decreased
      significantly and RMT decreased significantly (P < 0.01). The changes of
      ultra-structure of the pulmonary arteries showed lighten significantly.
      Plasma ET-1, ANP, and CGRP decreased significantly (all P < 0.01), whereas
      PAMP increased significantly than that of shunt group (P < 0.01).
      CONCLUSION: The reduced production of endogenous H2S is one of mechanism
      of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular structure remodeling in
      rats with high pulmonary blood flow. H2S plays an important regulatory
      effect on vasoactive peptide ET-1,+ ANP, CGRP and PAMP.

TI  - Enhanced detection and typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in
      anogenital samples with PGMY primers and the Linear array HPV genotyping
      test.
PG  - 1998-2006
AB  - The Roche PGMY primer-based research prototype line blot assay (PGMY-LB)
      is a convenient tool in epidemiological studies for the detection and
      typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA. This assay has been optimized
      and is being commercialized as the Linear Array HPV genotyping test
      (LA-HPV). We assessed the agreement between LA-HPV and PGMY-LB for
      detection and typing of 37 HPV genotypes in 528 anogenital samples (236
      anal, 146 physician-collected cervical, and 146 self-collected
      cervicovaginal swabs) obtained from human immunodeficiency
      virus-seropositive individuals (236 men and 146 women). HPV DNA was
      detected in 433 (82.0%) and 458 (86.7%) samples with PGMY-LB and LA-HPV (P
      = 0.047), respectively, for an excellent agreement of 93.8% (kappa =
      0.76). Of the 17,094 HPV typing results, 16,562 (1,743 positive and 14,819
      negative results) were concordant between tests (agreement = 96.9%; kappa
      = 0.76). The mean agreement between tests for each type was 96.4% +/- 2.4%
      (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.6% to 97.2%; range, 86% to 100%), for an
      excellent mean kappa value of 0.85 +/- 0.10 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.87).
      However, detection rates for most HPV types were greater with LA-HPV. The
      mean number of types per sample detected by LA-HPV (4.2 +/- 3.4; 95% CI,
      3.9 to 4.5; median, 3.0) was greater than that for PGMY-LB (3.4 +/- 3.0;
      95% CI, 3.1 to 3.6; median, 2.0) (P < 0.001). The number of types detected
      in excess by LA-HPV in anal samples correlated with the number of types
      per sample (r = 0.49 +/- 0.06; P = 0.001) but not with patient age (r =
      0.03 +/- 0.06; P = 0.57), CD4 cell counts (r = 0.06 +/- 0.06; P = 0.13),
      or the grade of anal disease (r = -0.11 +/- 0.06; P = 0.07). LA-HPV
      compared favorably with PGMY-LB but yielded higher detection rates for
      newer and well-known HPV types.

TI  - Early detection of progressive renal dysfunction in patients with coronary
      artery disease.
PG  - 2773-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: An association between renal hemodynamic dysfunction and
      coronary artery disease (CAD) has been documented in chronic renal
      failure; however, no information is available in CAD patients with normal
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This study was aimed at evaluating early
      abnormalities and outcome of renal function in CAD patients. METHODS: In
      15 nondiabetic patients with normal renal function and no significant
      stenoses in renal arteries, and having undergone coronary arteriography,
      we studied systemic and renal hemodynamics before and after a vasodilating
      stimulus induced by aminoacid (AA) infusion. A control group (C) consisted
      of 15 sex- and age-matched kidney donors. The statistical adequacy of the
      sample size was preliminarily verified. Renal clearances were repeated
      after two years. RESULTS: At baseline, GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) averaged 81.4
      +/- 3.8 in CAD and 83.7 +/- 1.4 in C (P= NS); RPF (mL/min/1.73 m2) was 297
      +/- 22 in CAD and 456 +/- 15 in C (P < 0.0001); filtration fraction was
      higher in CAD (P < 0.001). Plasma renin activity was higher in CAD (P <
      0.005). The number of coronary stenoses was inversely correlated with RPF
      but not with GFR. In CAD, at variance with C, AA did not induce any
      increment of GFR, while RPF increased without achieving the unstimulated
      value of C. Blood pressure was comparable in CAD and C at baseline and not
      modified by AA. After two years, a significant decrease in GFR (-14%, P <
      0.001) and RPF (-15%, P < 0.001) occurred only in CAD, and in either
      group, the response to AA did not differ from that detected at baseline.
      CONCLUSION: In CAD patients with normal GFR, reduction in renal perfusion
      and absence of renal functional reserve likely represent early markers of
      progressive renal dysfunction.

TI  - Familial risk assessment for early-onset coronary heart disease.
PG  - 525-31
AB  - PURPOSE: We examined the performance of a familial risk assessment method
      that stratifies risk for early-onset coronary heart disease by considering
      the number of relatives with coronary disease, degree of relationship,
      lineage, and age at diagnosis. METHODS: By using data from the
      HealthStyles 2003 survey, we assessed the associations between familial
      risk and early-onset coronary heart disease, diabetes,
      hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and obesity. By using area under the
      curve statistics, we evaluated the discriminatory ability of various risk
      assessment models. RESULTS: Of 4,035 respondents, 60% were female and 72%
      were white, with a mean age of 48.8 years. After adjustment for
      demographics, strong and moderate risk were significantly associated with
      approximately a five- and twofold risk of early-onset coronary disease,
      respectively. After adjustment for demographics and personal history of
      cardiovascular disease, strong familial risk was also significantly
      associated with diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and obesity.
      A risk assessment model that included familial risk, demographics, and
      personal history of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and
      obesity was most optimal with an area under the curve statistic of 87.2%
      CONCLUSIONS: Familial risk assessment can stratify risk for early-onset
      coronary heart disease. Several conditions associated with increased
      familial risk can be prevented. These results have important implications
      for risk assessment and risk-reducing interventions.

TI  - Parturition in the rat: a physiological pain model.
PG  - 1257-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain during labor is a common and severe phenomenon, but its
      clinical management remains haphazard because its neurophysiology is
      poorly understood. In the current study, the authors evaluate the
      parturient rat as a relevant model to study the pharmacology of labor
      pain. METHODS: Control of birth timing in term pregnant rats was achieved
      by gavage with RU 486 (5 mg/kg) the day before the expected day of
      parturition. The behavioral events preceding the expulsion of the first
      pup were analyzed, and immunodetection of the c-Fos protein was used to
      evaluate the spinal neuronal activity at the lumbosacral level where
      genital and perineal inputs terminate. RESULTS: Hind limb and abdominal
      stretches occurred during labor (mean number, 57 +/- 10), arbitrarily
      defined as the time elapsed between the first stretch and the expulsion of
      the first pup (mean duration, 62 +/- 5 min). Subcutaneous oxytocin
      increased the frequency of stretches, accounting for the fact that these
      manifestations are linked to uterine contractions. Finally, epidural
      morphine (30 microg/10 microl) in oxytocin-treated rats, although
      resulting in no change of labor duration, significantly decreased the
      number of stretches (8 +/- 2 vs. 57 +/- 12 for epidural saline) and the
      number of c-Fos-positive neurons in the lumbosacral spinal segments (80
      +/- 25 vs. 165 +/- 17 for epidural saline). CONCLUSIONS: These results
      indicate that stretches during labor in the rat correspond to a behavioral
      response to nociception associated with uterine contractions and suggest
      that parturition in the rat could be a relevant model to investigate
      nociceptive mechanisms associated with parturition in women.

TI  - A cellular deficiency of gangliosides causes hypersensitivity to
      Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C.
PG  - 26680-9
AB  - Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C (Cp-PLC), also called alpha-toxin,
      is the major virulence factor in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene.
      Previously, a cellular UDP-Glc deficiency was related with a
      hypersensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of Cp-PLC. Because UDP-Glc is
      required in the synthesis of proteoglycans, N-linked glycoproteins, and
      glycosphingolipids, the role of these gly-coconjugates in the cellular
      sensitivity to Cp-PLC was studied. The cellular sensitivity to Cp-PLC was
      significantly enhanced by glycosphingolipid synthesis inhibitors, and a
      mutant cell line deficient in gangliosides was found to be hypersensitive
      to Cp-PLC. Gangliosides protected hypersensitive cells from the cytotoxic
      effect of Cp-PLC and prevented its membrane-disrupting effect on
      artificial membranes. Removal of sialic acids by C. perfringens sialidase
      increases the sensitivity of cultured cells to Cp-PLC and intramuscular
      co-injection of C. perfringens sialidase, and Cp-PLC in mice potentiates
      the myotoxic effect of the latter. This work demonstrated that a reduction
      in gangliosides renders cells more susceptible to the membrane damage
      caused by Cp-PLC and revealed a previously unrecognized synergism between
      Cp-PLC and C. perfringens sialidase, providing new insights toward
      understanding the pathogenesis of clostridial myonecrosis.

TI  - Investigations into the prevention of prenatal and lactogenic Toxocara
      canis infections in puppies by application of moxidectin to the pregnant
      dog.
PG  - 218-23
AB  - Aim of the investigation was to examine whether two administrations of
      moxidectin to pregnant dogs could prevent pre-natal and lactogenic
      infections of puppies with reactivated Toxocara canis larvae. Four
      pregnant beagles, infected experimentally with 20 000 embryonated eggs of
      T. canis, were treated subcutaneously with 1 mg moxidectin per kg body
      weight on days 40 and 55 of pregnancy (5-13 days before parturition). One
      further dam and its puppies served as untreated control. Two applications
      of moxidectin completely prevented pre-natal and lactogenic infections in
      the puppies. Neither intestinal stages nor somatic larvae were found in
      the dams or their corresponding puppies. All puppies and dams of the
      treatment group remained coproscopically negative until 42 days after
      parturition. The administration of moxidectin did not show any side
      effects in the dams. None of the puppies of the treated dams showed any
      pathological abnormalities. In the untreated dam one adult and 26 somatic
      larvae of T. canis were detected at necropsy. All puppies of the untreated
      dam showed a patent T. canis infection from day 28 post-natum (p.n.); 296
      pre-adult and adult stages of T. canis were spontaneously eliminated and
      51 intestinal stages and five somatic larvae of T. canis were recovered at
      necropsy. In contrast to the puppies of the treated dams all negative
      control puppies showed blood eosinophilia after parturition and elevated
      liver enzyme levels.

TI  - [Vitamin D: synthesis, metabolism, regulation, and an assessment of its
      deficiency in patients with chronic renal disease].
PG  - 537-43
AB  - The main source of vitamin D in a man is its synthesis in human skin.
      7-Dehydrocholesterol converts into cholecalciferol--vitamin D3--as a
      result of UV radiation. Cholecalciferol hydroxylates in liver into
      25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D, calcidiol], which concentration in blood is
      a relevant indicator of the total of vitamin D in a human body. 25(OH)D
      hydroxylates in kidneys into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D,
      calcitriol], which is considered an active metabolite of vitamin D.
      Epidemiological studies showed high prevalence of low concentrations of
      25(OH)D especially in older population and people with chronic diseases.
      25(OH)D concentrations were defined at which rise parathormone levels,
      increases bone conversion, impairs bone mineralization and develops
      osteomalacia. Based on these results a deficiency of vitamin D was
      defined. Patients with chronic renal disease experience development of
      serious bone impairments described as renal osteodystrophy. These
      disorders are caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism which develops as a
      result of mineral metabolism impairment, especially of hypocalemia,
      25(OH)D deficiency, and insufficient synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D. Presently
      published guidelines K/DOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic
      Kidney Disease: Evaluation, Classification and Stratification define
      processes of vitamin D supplementation, particularly 1,25(OH)2D according
      to a degree of renal disease. Early prevention and treatment of
      hypovitaminosis D is a treatment goal in order to reduce or stop
      development of secondary hyperparathyroidism with its consequences for
      bone metabolism.

PG  - 307-9
AB  - Pregnancies resulting from a spontaneous ovulation and fertilization are
      extremely rare in women with Turner syndrome. The majority of them end
      with abortion, still-born, or neonates with congenital defects. The
      article presents two women with Turner syndrome, mosaic karyotype
      45,X/46,XX, who got pregnant without any medical intervention. The course
      of one pregnancy was complicated by imminent premature delivery,
      pyelonephritis and anaemia. Because of the lack of progress and
      threatening infection, the delivery was conducted by caesarean section in
      40th week of pregnancy. Healthy male neonate was born. The other patient
      gave birth in 38th week of pregnancy to a healthy baby boy, by caesarean
      section, because of lack of progress in delivery. Children develop
      correctly. It is important to note, that despite distinct clinical
      features, in first patient Turner syndrome was identified 3 years after
      delivery.

TI  - Localisation of heme oxygenase isoforms in allergic human nasal mucosa.
PG  - 595-8
AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenously produced gas mediator produced by
      heme oxygenase (HO). Like nitric oxide (NO), CO is produced in the nasal
      mucosa. Given that induced NO synthase (iNOS) expression in nasal mucosa
      has been found to be up-regulated in allergic rhinitis, the current study
      investigated the expression of HO isoforms in allergic human nasal mucosa.
      Immunohistochemical staining for type 1 and 2 HO isoforms were carried out
      in nasal inferior turbinate mucosa from six patients with persistent
      allergic rhinitis, and compared with six control patients without nasal
      allergy. Focal and weak expression of HO-1 was observed in seromucous
      glands, with no difference between allergic and control specimens.
      Vascular endothelium, erythrocytes, smooth muscle and inflammatory cells
      (except macrophages) in the allergic group exhibited stronger HO-1
      immunoreactivity compared to the control. Minimal expression was found in
      the respiratory epithelium in either group. Intravascular HO-1 expression
      was found in the allergic mucosa only. Intense HO-2 immunoreactivity was
      observed in the respiratory epithelium, vascular endothelium and
      seromucous glands in both allergic and control groups with no differences
      in intensity. In conclusion, unlike iNOS, HO-1 is minimally expressed in
      the nasal respiratory epithelium of either group. However, our findings
      suggest that it may be involved in the inflammatory process of allergic
      rhinitis at the submucosal level.

TI  - Bone, body weight, and weight reduction: what are the concerns?
PG  - 1453-6
AB  - Of the U.S. population, 65% is either overweight or obese, and weight loss
      is recommended to reduce co-morbid conditions. However, bone mobilization
      and loss may also occur with weight loss. The risk for bone loss depends
      on initial body weight, age, gender, physical activity, and conditions of
      dieting such as the extent of energy restriction and specific levels of
      nutrient intake. Older populations are more prone to bone loss with weight
      loss; in women, this is due at least in part to a reduced dietary Ca
      intake and/or efficiency of absorption. Potential hormonal mechanisms
      regulating bone loss during weight loss are discussed, including decreases
      in estrogen, leptin, glucagon-like peptide-2, growth hormone, and
      insulin-like growth factor-1, or an increase in cortisol. In contrast, the
      rise in adiponectin and ghrelin with weight reduction should not be
      detrimental to bone. Combining energy restriction with exercise does not
      necessarily prevent bone loss, but may attenuate loss as was shown with
      additional Ca intake or osteoporosis medications. Future controlled weight
      loss trials should be designed to further address mechanisms influencing
      the density and quality of bone sites vulnerable to fracture, in the
      prevention of osteoporosis.

TI  - Management of adenoid cystic carcinoma of minor salivary glands.
PG  - 1114-20
AB  - PURPOSE: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant tumor
      originating from the salivary glands. The characteristic clinicopathologic
      features of this tumor are perineural spread, local recurrences, and
      distant metastases. Radical surgery combined with radiotherapy, as
      mentioned in the literature, is the best method of treatment. This
      clinical review article is intended to analyze the outcome of management
      of a group of 22 ACC patients, who were treated in our clinic. METHODS:
      Between 1985 and 2000, 22 patients with ACC of minor salivary glands were
      treated in the Clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the "G.
      Papanikolaou" General Hospital, in Thessaloniki. The age range was 22 to
      87 years. The distribution of the primary sites was buccal mucosa (3),
      floor of the mouth (1), hard palate (3), soft palate (2), junction of hard
      and soft palate (7), and hard or soft palate with spread in the paranasal
      sinus etc (6). All the patients were treated radically with surgery. The
      surgery was combined with radiotherapy in 17 patients. A total dose of 60
      Gy in a 30- to 40-day period was given, using conventional 2 Gy fractions
      per day. Immunohistochemical assay of the expression of the Ki-67 antigen
      was performed on a subset of 15 cases. RESULTS: The mean follow-up range
      was 4 to 14 years. From the 22 patients, 15 (68.18%) were alive for more
      than 5 years and 6 (27.7%) had died from the disease. Eight patients were
      free of the disease for more than 5 years (ranging from 7 to 14), 4
      patients were free of the disease for 5 years, and 3 patients were free of
      the disease for 4 years. One patient lived more than 10 years and died
      from another cause. Local recurrence was developed in 2 patients. One
      recurrence occurred within the first year after the treatment and the
      second local recurrence occurred 13 years after the initial treatment.
      Lymph node metastases occurred in 2 patients, 3 years and 7 years after
      completing the treatment. Distant metastases (lung) occurred in 2
      patients, 2 years and 6 years after completing the treatment. The
      Mann-Whitney statistical analysis was used for comparing the Ki-67 values
      in correlation with prognosis and location of ACCs. The Ki-67 value was
      significantly higher in tumors from patients with treatment failure than
      in nonfailures (P < .001). The Ki-67 expression was also higher in large
      tumors characterized by wide topical spread (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: The
      most proper method of treatment for ACC seems to be radical resection
      combined with radiotherapy. The treatment failure is associated with
      positive margins of the excised surgical specimen and named nerve
      involvement. The immunohistochemical study of Ki-67 expression may provide
      additional prognostic information for this tumor.

      subsequent patient management. METHODS: A questionnaire was used to assess
      the impact of FDG PET scan on diagnosis, management and clinical
      decision-making processes for epilepsy surgery from the managing
      clinician's perspective. FDG PET scan results were also compared with MRI,
      EEG and SPECT results and coded according to whether the FDG PET scan
      provided independent information and localisation of epileptogenic
      regions. RESULTS: A total of 118 eligible patients under the age of 14
      years were identified, with questionnaires being completed on 113
      evaluable patients (96%). The pre-PET management plan consisted of
      consideration for surgery in 92 patients (81%) and medical therapy for the
      remaining 21 patients (19%). Managing physicians rated FDG PET as
      providing information additional to that obtained with other
      investigations regarding epileptogenic sites in 88 patients (77%). FDG PET
      had either a minor or a major impact on clinical management in 58 patients
      (51%), principally with regard to surgical candidacy. CONCLUSION: FDG PET
      has a definite role in the assessment of paediatric patients with
      refractory epilepsy who are being considered for surgery. In the future,
      analysis of FDG PET data in specific subpopulations of children with
      refractory epilepsy may lead to novel insights regarding aetiology.

      neutralizing antibody against SARS coronavirus.
PG  - 4959-68
AB  - Different forms of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein-based
      vaccines for generation of neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV
      were compared using a mouse model. High IgG levels were detected in mice
      immunized with intraperitoneal (i.p.) recombinant spike polypeptide
      generated by Escherichia coli (S-peptide), mice primed with intramuscular
      (i.m.) tPA-optimize800 DNA vaccine (tPA-S-DNA) and boosted with i.p.
      S-peptide, mice primed with i.m. CTLA4HingeSARS800 DNA vaccine
      (CTLA4-S-DNA) and boosted with i.p. S-peptide, mice primed with oral
      live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella-S-DNA-control) and
      boosted with i.p. S-peptide, mice primed with oral live-attenuated S.
      typhimurium that contained tPA-optimize800 DNA vaccine
      (Salmonella-tPA-S-DNA) and boosted with i.p. S-peptide, and mice primed
      with oral live-attenuated S. typhimurium that contained CTLA4HingeSARS800
      DNA vaccine (Salmonella-tPA-S-DNA) and boosted with i.p. S-peptide. No
      statistical significant difference was observed among the Th1/Th2 index
      among these six groups of mice with high IgG levels. Sera of all six mice
      immunized with i.p. S-peptide, i.m. DNA vaccine control and oral
      Salmonella-S-DNA-control showed no neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV.
      Sera of the mice immunized with i.m. tPA-S-DNA, i.m. CTLA4-S-DNA, oral
      Salmonella-S-DNA-control boosted with i.p. S-peptide, oral
      Salmonella-tPA-S-DNA, oral Salmonella-tPA-S-DNA boosted with i.p
      S-peptide, oral Salmonella-CTLA4-S-DNA and oral Salmonella-CTLA4-S-DNA
      boosted with i.p. S-peptide showed neutralizing antibody titers of
      <1:20-1:160. Sera of all the mice immunized with i.m. tPA-S-DNA boosted
      with i.p. S-peptide and i.m. CTLA4-S-DNA boosted with i.p. S-peptide
      showed neutralizing antibody titers of >or=1:1280. The present observation
      may have major practical value, such as immunization of civet cats, since
      production of recombinant proteins from E. coli is far less expensive than
      production of recombinant proteins using eukaryotic systems.

TI  - Toxicoepidemiology in Zimbabwe: pesticide poisoning admissions to major
      hospitals.
PG  - 59-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute pesticide poisoning (APP) is a well-recognized cause of
      morbidity and mortality but is not well described in developing countries.
      We describe the toxicoepidemiology of APP in Zimbabwe. METHODS: All cases
      of APP admitted to eight major referral hospitals in Zimbabwe from January
      1998 to December 1999 (inclusive) were identified using ICD-9 codes and
      ward registers and relevant information recorded on a standard data
      collection sheet. RESULTS: There were a total of 914 single pesticide
      exposures. Almost half (49.1%) resulted from oral exposure to
      rodenticides, 42.2% from anticholinesterase-type pesticides (AChTP),
      mostly organophosphates (OP) that were responsible for over 90% of
      admissions from AChTP. Accidental and deliberate self-poisoning (27.1% and
      58.6%, respectively) accounted for most cases with only eight homicides.
      The case fatality rate (CFR) in deaths/100 admissions was 6.8 [62 deaths;
      95% Confidence Interval (CI) 5.2-8.6] and was significantly higher in
      males (9.4) than females (4.1) (CI for difference in proportions;
      2.0-8.5). In addition, the CFR for deliberate self-poisoning (DSP), 6.5
      deaths/100 admissions, was also significantly higher than that for
      accidental poisoning (0.8 deaths/100 admissions) (CI for difference in
      proportions 3.2-7.9). Organophosphates were implicated in 70.9% of all
      fatalities, with over 20% resulting from oral exposure to rat poison (RP).
      CONCLUSION: Organophosphates and rat poison (RP) are the leading causes of
      APP admissions to major referral hospitals in Zimbabwe, with most of the
      admissions being the result of deliberate self-poisoning. Greater control
      in the sale and use of these products could help prevent significant
      morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Cell wall remodeling at the fission yeast cell division site requires the
      Rho-GEF Rgf3p.
PG  - 5563-73
AB  - Cytokinesis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is accompanied by several stages
      of cell wall remodeling at the division site. Coincident with actomyosin
      ring constriction, primary and secondary septa are deposited and then the
      primary septum is degraded to release daughter cells from one another.
      These steps require the activities of glucan synthases and glucanases,
      respectively, which must be coordinated with one another to prevent cell
      lysis. The lad1-1 mutation undergoes cell lysis specifically at cell
      division owing to the absence of the Rgf3p Rho1-guanine nucleotide
      exchange factor (GEF) at the division site. Electron microscopic analysis
      indicates that lysis occurs only as the primary septum begins to be
      degraded. Overproduction of either Rho1p or the previously uncharacterized
      Rab-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) involved in secretion, Gyp10p,
      suppresses lad1-1 lethality. Rgf3p is periodically produced in an
      Ace2p-dependent manner and localizes to the medial region of the cell
      early in mitosis, a pattern of expression distinct from the highly related
      Rho-GEF, Rgf1p. Although rgf1+ is not an essential gene, it is
      synthetically lethal with rgf2-deleted cells whereas no negative genetic
      interactions were detected between rgf2-deleted cells and lad1-1. Our data
      suggest that the three closely related fission yeast Rho-GEF molecules
      perform two distinct essential functions. Rgf3p appears necessary to
      stimulate Rho1p-mediated activation of a glucan synthase crucial after
      septation for proper new cell-end formation.

TI  - Reproducibility of heart rate variability and blood pressure variability
      in individuals with spinal cord injury.
PG  - 387-93
AB  - Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are prone to orthostatic
      intolerance and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The use of
      heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) as
      indices of cardiovascular regulation would be valuable in this population;
      however, their reproducibility has yet to be tested in those with SCI. The
      purpose of this study was to examine the day-to-day reproducibility of
      resting HRV and BPV in individuals with SCI. Ten individuals (age 35.9 +/-
      13.2 yrs) with chronic (5.4 +/- 7.7 years post injury) SCI (C4-T12; ASIA
      A-C) participated. On two occasions within a two-week period, 10-minute
      supine electrocardiogram and Finapres blood pressure recordings were
      obtained during spontaneous breathing. Computer software calculated
      frequency domain measures of HRV and BPV (Low frequency (LF) power, High
      frequency (HF) power, and LF:HF ratio). Intraclass correlations
      coefficients (R) were used as an index of day-to-day reproducibility, and
      analyses were conducted on all participants and only those with
      tetraplegia. For HRV, measures of heart rate, LF, and LF:HF were found to
      be highly reproducible (R = 0.82-0.88); however, the reproducibility of HF
      was found to be poor (all participants: R = 0.53, tetraplegia: R = 0.66).
      Measures of blood pressure as well as systolic BPV also showed high
      reproducibility (R = 0.72-0.93). Measures of diastolic BPV were less
      reproducible but still acceptable (R = 0.71-0.89) with the exception of
      LF:HF(DBP) (R = 0.51). In conclusion, despite the autonomic dysfunction
      associated with SCI, measures of HRV and BPV may still be used as
      reproducible indices of autonomic cardiovascular regulation in this
      population.

TI  - Predictable correction of the unfused lumbar lordosis after thoracic
      correction and fusion in Scheuermann kyphosis.
PG  - 1227-31
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective examination of preoperative and
      postoperative radiographs of the sagittal spine of 30 patients with
      Scheuermann kyphosis. OBJECTIVES: To determine significant correlations
      between kyphosis and lordosis in Scheuermann kyphosis, determine
      predictability of spontaneous sagittal lordosis correction after thoracic
      correction and fusion, and understand better the biomechanics of the
      spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies described relations
      between kyphosis and lordosis in healthy people. To our knowledge, no
      relationships, have been described between kyphosis and lordosis in
      Scheuermann kyphosis. METHODS: On radiographs, maximum kyphosis, maximum
      lordosis, sacral slope and L5-S1 angle were measured in the preoperative
      and postoperative standing lateral radiographs of the spine, and
      correlations were calculated. RESULTS: Preoperative significant
      correlations were present between kyphosis and lordosis (R = 0.421; P =
      0.021), and between lordosis and sacral slope (R = 0.824; P < 0001).
      Postoperative correlations were stronger (R = 0.591; P = 0.001 and R =
      0.844; P < 0.001). The percentage of correction of kyphosis was correlated
      with the percentage of spontaneous decrease of lordosis (R = 0.593; P <
      0.001). A negative correlation between L5-S1 angle and upper lumbar
      segment of lordosis was found before and after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study shows a significant correlation between kyphosis and lordosis before
      and after surgery. Surgical correction of thoracic hyperkyphosis gives a
      predictable spontaneous decrease of lumbar lordosis. Correction of
      lordosis occurs mainly in the upper segment of lumbar lordosis.

      formal inclusion of quality of life (QoL) as an outcome measure in CF
      clinical trials is becoming more common. Both an appropriate QoL measure
      and sound methodology are required in order to draw valid inferences about
      treatments and QoL. A review was undertaken of randomised controlled
      trials in cystic fibrosis where QoL was measured. EMBASE, MEDLINE and ISI
      Web of Science were searched to locate all full papers in the English
      language reporting randomised controlled trials in cystic fibrosis,
      published between January 1991 and December 2004. All Cochrane reviews
      published before December 2004 were hand searched. Papers were included if
      the authors had reported that they had measured QoL or well being in the
      trial. 16 trials were identified. The interventions investigated were:
      antibiotics (4); home versus hospital administration of antibiotics (1);
      steroids (1); mucolytic therapies (6); exercise (3) and pancreatic enzymes
      (1). Not one trial evaluated in this review provided conclusive results
      concerning QoL. This review highlights many of the pitfalls of QoL
      measurement in CF clinical trials and provides constructive information
      concerning the design and reporting of trials measuring QoL.

TI  - Characterization of 133Xe gas washout in pulmonary emphysema with dynamic
      133Xe SPECT functional images.
PG  - 71-80
AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize regional ventilation impairment of pulmonary
      emphysema using dynamic 133Xe single photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT) functional images, compared with other forms of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Dynamic 133Xe SPECT was
      performed in 34 patients with emphysema and 15 patients with other forms
      of COPD. Three-dimensional voxel-based functional images of the
      half-clearance time (T1/2) mainly reflecting the initial rapid washout of
      133Xe gas from the large airways, and of the mean transit time (MTT)
      reflecting 133Xe gas washout from the entire lungs, including the small
      airways and alveoli, were created based on an area-over-height method.
      T1/2 and MTT values were compared with the regional extent of low
      attenuation areas (%LAA) on density-mask computed tomography images and
      the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). RESULTS:
      The MTT/T1/2 ratio in each lung in emphysema was significantly higher than
      that in other forms of COPD (1.60+/-0.74 vs. 1.21+/-0.26; P<0.01). In the
      selected unilateral lungs with similar T1/2 values, MTT values were also
      significantly higher in emphysema. MTT values in each lung showed a
      significantly closer correlation with the corresponding %LAA values
      compared with T1/2 values in emphysema (R=0.698, P<0.0001 vs. R=0.338,
      P<0.01; P<0.05); while only the T1/2 values showed a significant
      correlation in other forms of COPD (P<0.0001). In correlation with DLCO,
      MTT values showed a significantly closer correlation compared with T1/2
      values in emphysema (R=0.909, P<0.0001 vs. R=0.555, P<0.001; P<0.05);
      while either value did not show a significant correlation in other forms
      of COPD. CONCLUSION: MTT values are more critically affected in emphysema
      compared with other forms of COPD without significant alveolar
      destruction, and MTT and T1/2 values appear to be differently correlated
      with the regional extent of LAA between these two disorders. Direct
      comparison of regional T1/2 and MTT values on functional images may
      contribute to the demarcation of lung pathology of these two disorders.

TI  - [Atherosclerosis and the kidney].
PG  - 183-202
AB  - Diffuse atherosclerosis entails a 15-30% risk of plaques on renal arteries
      (ARAS), with a correlation with coronary atherosclerosis. Ischemia induces
      generation of angiotensin II (Ang II) that maintains sufficient
      hydrostatic pressure within the tuft to preserve the GFR. Ang II
      inhibition suppresses this protective mechanism. In fact, any
      antihypertensive drug may lead to reaching a "critical perfusion
      pressure". ARAS should be suspected in case of renal asymmetry. It should
      also be envisaged in case of "flash pulmonary edemas". Ultrasonography and
      renal tomography show aortic calcifications and often the outline of an
      abdominal aortic aneurysm. Tomodensitometry may detect large aorto-renal
      plaques. Spiral scanner tomography represents a progress, in terms of
      renal artery imaging and of renal cortical atrophy. Magnetic resonance
      imaging is less accurate but avoids iodine toxicity. The best noninvasive
      method is pulsed echo-doppler. It is particularly useful for evaluating
      stenoses progression. Some stenoses progress to renal atrophy and renal
      artery thrombosis, whereas others follow a stable course. Pulsed Doppler
      helps predict whether revascularization will improve renal function,
      according to the resistance index. Renal arteriography entails a high risk
      of cholesterol crystal embolism. However, it is the obligatory first step
      for angioplasty and stent positioning, indicated when the kidney is not
      atrophic. The indication for revascularization essentially depends on
      evaluation of the benefits vs risks of angioplasty or surgery. Some
      publications underscore the frequent stability of renal function and the
      fact that, revascularized or not, most patients will shortly die of
      myocardial infarction. Renal cholesterol crystal embolism (CCE) is a
      severe condition, which occurs when large arteries undergo surgery,
      aortography or interventional radiology. Anticoagulants are a frequent
      cause of CCE. CCE may also occur spontaneously, resulting in slowly
      progressive renal insufficiency. Migration of crystals in small caliber
      intrarenal arteries induces obstruction, followed by an inflammatory
      reaction. The clinical picture resembles angiitis, with laboratory
      evidence of inflammation along with high eosinophil counts and
      hypocomplementemia. Diagnosis rests on: 1) a iatrogenic event in a patient
      with an atherosclerotic background; 2) examination of the skin disclosing
      purple toes, small necrotic lesions and livedo of the lower limbs.
      Crystals may also be found by funduscopy. Skin or muscle biopsy are
      contributive in showing crystals and help avoid renal biopsy; 3) other
      localizations involve the mesenteric circulation and the central nervous
      system. Until recently, the prognosis was considered disastrous. However,
      a recently published treatment schedule proved efficient in reducing
      mortality. A last issue regarding the relationships between
      atherosclerosis and the kidney deserves mention. In an autopsy-based study
      it was shown that atherosclerosis per se is accompanied by an increase in
      the glomerular surface area along with a greater proportion of obsolescent
      glomeruli by comparison with matched controls. Finally, it should be
      recalled that atherogenic hyperlipidemia usually aggravates the course of
      any renal disease, including ARAS. Treatment with statins is indicated in
      all forms of atherosclerotic renal disease.

TI  - Decreased CD4+ lymphocytes and innate immune responses in adults with
      previous extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 916-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: CD4+ lymphocytes control Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection
      through cytokine-mediated macrophage activation. Extrapulmonary
      tuberculosis is presumably a marker of immunodeficiency, but cytokine
      responses have not been well studied in such patients. OBJECTIVE: Assess
      immune defects in persons with previous extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
      METHODS: In vitro cytokine responses of PBMCs from HIV-seronegative adults
      with previous extrapulmonary tuberculosis (n = 10) were compared with
      responses from persons with previous pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 24) and
      latent M tuberculosis infection (n = 30) in a case-control study. RESULTS:
      Patients and controls did not differ according to age, sex, race, or
      monocytes. The median time between tuberculosis diagnosis and study entry
      was 72 and 122 weeks in extrapulmonary and pulmonary patients,
      respectively (P = .2). Median CD4+ counts were 660, 814, and 974
      lymphocytes/mm3 in extrapulmonary, pulmonary, and latently infected
      patients, respectively (P = .03). At 48 hours, median unstimulated
      cytokine levels were uniformly lower in extrapulmonary patients than both
      sets of controls. These differences persisted after controlling for CD4+
      count by linear regression analysis. Despite lower unstimulated levels,
      median TNF-alpha response was higher in patients with extrapulmonary and
      pulmonary tuberculosis than latently infected persons after stimulation
      with PHA 1% (P = .006) and PHA+IL-12 (1 ng/mL; P = .02); IL-10 remained
      low in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis after the same stimuli (P
      = .04 and .06, respectively). There was no primary immunodeficiency in the
      IL-12/23-IFN-gamma axis. CONCLUSION: HIV-seronegative adults with previous
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis had lower CD4+ lymphocytes and unstimulated
      cytokine production. This suggests a subtle abnormality in innate immune
      function. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These characteristics could identify
      persons at risk for severe tuberculosis manifestations.

TI  - Stepping onto a single step: a kinematic study.
PG  - 81-92
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To describe the timings and ranges of linear
      displacements of the pelvis and feet occurring in a healthy older
      population when stepping up onto a step, and to describe variations noted
      in a small sample of subjects with hemiplegia. METHOD: An observational
      case series study design was used and the study took place in a gait
      laboratory in a general hospital. A convenience sample of 54 healthy
      volunteers (mean age 57.6 years, range 40-90 years; 26 males, 28 females)
      and six subjects with chronic hemiplegia (mean age 61.7 years, range 47-70
      years; five males, one female) was recruited. Participants stepped up onto
      an 18 cm step. The following outcome measures were made: kinematic
      measures of stepping up cycle time; pelvic lateral displacement; width of
      foot base; and height of heel clearance by use of CODA (a
      three-dimensional movement analysis system). RESULTS: The mean (standard
      deviation, SD) stepping up cycle of healthy subjects was 1.68 seconds (+/-
      0.22 seconds). The total range of pelvic lateral displacement during one
      stepping up cycle was 70 mm. Pelvic lateral displacement was asymmetrical,
      being significantly greater towards the initial weightbearing leg
      (p<0.0001). Older subjects (aged 60+ years) had less heel clearance
      (p<0.03) than younger subjects (aged <60 years). Stepping up performance
      by subjects with hemiplegia showed wide inter-subject variability, and was
      observed to be as much as three times slower to use as much as four times
      the range of pelvic lateral displacement and twice the foot base, and to
      be asymmetrical in timing of the stepping up cycle. CONCLUSIONS: This
      kinematic study describes a healthy stepping up pattern not previously
      reported. Age and hemiplegia influenced the amount and speed of movement
      adopted during the task. Information about the movement strategies used by
      the elderly and those with hemiplegia should guide physiotherapists in
      their management of physical function.

TI  - A comparison of dosing regimens of paricalcitol capsule for the treatment
      of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD stages 3 and 4.
PG  - 105-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent dosing of calcitriol for secondary
      hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) has been associated with greater parathyroid
      hormone (PTH) reduction with fewer calcemic and phosphatemic effects than
      daily (QD) dosing. METHODS: Secondary analyses of three randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter studies in stage 3 and 4
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with SHPT were performed to compare
      three times per week (TIW) with QD dosing of paricalcitol. The
      pharmacokinetics of TIW and QD dosing of paricalcitol capsules were
      assessed in a separate group of healthy subjects. RESULTS:
      Pharmacokinetics revealed similar steady state paricalcitol exposure
      between dosing regimens. In CKD patients, baseline data were similar
      between the TIW studies (n = 72, paricalcitol; n = 73, placebo) and QD
      studies (n = 35, paricalcitol; n = 40, placebo). Both dosing regimens
      resulted in similar efficacy (91%) for the primary end point of two
      consecutive > or = 30% decreases in intact PTH from baseline, but the QD
      regimen resulted in a greater percent reduction in intact PTH from
      baseline. The chances for developing increased serum calcium and
      phosphorus levels or Ca x P product were similar between paricalcitol and
      placebo groups for both treatment regimens. Furthermore, no difference in
      the risk for these elevations was detected between the TIW and QD
      regimens. CONCLUSIONS: QD dosing of paricalcitol capsules is as
      efficacious as TIW dosing in achieving the primary end point (2
      consecutive > or = 30% reductions in PTH) in stage 3 and 4 CKD patients
      with SHPT. Moreover, the QD regimen had no significant effect on
      hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia or Ca x P product as compared with
      placebo or intermittent dosing.

TI  - Is a dual-sensor pacemaker appropriate in patients with sino-atrial
      disease? Results from the DUSISLOG study.
PG  - 34-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rate-responsive pacemakers (PMs) are often supplied with
      accelerometer (XL) and minute ventilation (MV) sensors to provide a
      physiologic rate response according to patient needs. No information is
      available about the real benefit of dual-sensor rate-responsive pacing on
      the daily life of patients. METHODS: DUSISLOG (Dual Sensor vs Single
      Sensor comparison using patient activity LOGbook) is a two-arm
      prospective, randomized, multicenter study that enrolled 105 patients who
      received a rate-responsive PM (Insignia), Guidant Corp.). After 1 month of
      DDD pacing at 60 ppm lower rate, a single sensor (XL or MV, randomized)
      was activated for 3 months at the manufacturer's suggested nominal
      settings, followed by a 3-month period with dual sensors optimized with
      automatic response. During the last month of each period, the following
      data concerning patient physical activity were retrieved from PM
      diagnostics (Activity Log): mean percentage of physical activity, mean
      intensity of activity. Quality of life (QoL) scores and 6-minute walk test
      (WT) were also recorded. RESULTS: Single-sensor rate-responsive pacing
      resulted in symptomatic benefit equally with XL and MV sensors while no
      additional benefit was found using dual sensor. In a subgroup analysis,
      patients (17%) with marked chronotropic incompetence and with 0% atrial
      sensing received benefits from single sensor with an additional advantage
      from sensor (QoL: +21 +/- 14% P < 0.05; WT: +17 +/- 7% P < 0.02).
      CONCLUSION: In most patients with rate-responsive devices, a single sensor
      is sufficient to achieve a satisfactory rate response. A dual sensor
      combination and optimization provides an additional benefit only in a
      selected population with an advanced atrial chronotropic disease.

TI  - Beta 4 integrin amplifies ErbB2 signaling to promote mammary
      tumorigenesis.
PG  - 489-502
AB  - Amplification of the ErbB2 locus, which encodes a receptor tyrosine
      kinase, is common in aggressive breast tumors and correlates with poor
      prognosis. The mechanisms underlying ErbB2-mediated breast carcinoma
      progression remain incompletely defined. To examine the role of the
      signaling and cell-adhesion receptor beta 4 integrin during ErbB2-mediated
      tumorigenesis, we introduced a targeted deletion of the beta 4 signaling
      domain into a mouse model of ErbB2-induced mammary carcinoma. Loss of beta
      4 signaling suppresses mammary tumor onset and invasive growth. Ex vivo
      studies indicate that beta 4 forms a complex with ErbB2 and enhances
      activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and c-Jun. STAT3 contributes
      to disruption of epithelial adhesion and polarity, while c-Jun is required
      for hyperproliferation. Finally, deletion of the beta 4 signaling domain
      enhances the efficacy of ErbB2-targeted therapy. These results indicate
      that beta 4 integrin promotes tumor progression by amplifying ErbB2
      signaling and identify beta 4 as a potential target for molecular therapy
      of breast cancer.

TI  - [Macular area in glaucoma patients].
PG  - 224-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible use of HRT II and OCT 3 for detection
      and monitoring of glaucoma changes in the macular area. METHODS: In the
      retrospective study 65 eyes (13 healthy and 52 with primary open angle
      glaucoma) of 36 patients have been monitored. All patients underwent
      complete ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity testing,
      biomicroscopy of fundus, computer perimetry, HRT II and eleven patients
      were examined using OCT 3. The visual field has been tested on HFA
      (Humphrey Field Analyzer) using the full threshold test 30-2. Foveolar
      sensitivity and foveolar sensitivity compared to the age have been
      evaluated. The optic nerve head has been examined and subsequently
      evaluated using HRT II. The retinal nerve fiber layer (t-RNFL) and Cup
      Shape Measurement (t-CSM) in the temporal area have been monitored. The
      macula has been examined on OCT 3. Foveolar thickness, inner and outer
      macular thickness, average macular thickness and aggregate macular volume
      have been monitored. RESULTS: Decrease of the visual acuity and foveolar
      sensitivity have been registered with the deterioration of the visual
      field. Further general decrease of the value of t-RNFL and increase of the
      t-CSM index have been registered from the results of the HRT II
      examinations. This corresponds to decrease of the nerve fibers and
      excavation deepening in the temporal area. Average macular thickness and
      total macular volume examined on OCT 3 demonstrate aggregate decrease of
      values with the progressive changes in the visual field. CONCLUSION: With
      the progressive visual field changes with the open angle glaucoma patients
      occurs also deterioration of finding in the macular area. Changes
      discovered using the subjective examination and expressed as a slight
      decrease of the visual acuity as well as decrease of the foveolar
      sensitivity on HFA can be objectively proved using HRT II and OCT 3.

TI  - Botulinum toxin for the management of bladder dysfunction.
PG  - 1301-18
AB  - This review highlights a recent innovation in the medical treatment of
      detrusor overactivity (DO). Anticholinergics are usually the gold standard
      to treat bladder overactivity. Adverse effects and lack of efficacy are
      the two main causes for considering alternative treatments. Until
      recently, invasive surgery (mainly bladder augmentation) was the only
      available treatment option for patients with intractable DO. This article
      considers botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injection as an alternative
      treatment to surgery in patients with DO who do not respond to
      anticholinergic therapy. To identify papers for inclusion in this review,
      we searched PubMed with the keywords 'botulinum toxin', 'overactive
      bladder', 'urinary incontinence' and 'neurogenic bladder' for the years
      2000-5. Review articles were not included. Abstracts were cited only if
      they contained important new information. Experimental animal studies and
      articles or book chapters related to the use of botulinum toxin for other
      indications (such as achalasia and cervical dystonia) were analysed with
      regard to the mechanisms of action of botulinum toxin. From this review,
      it appears that BTX-A injection into the detrusor muscle is a very
      effective method for treating urinary incontinence secondary to neurogenic
      detrusor overactivity (NDO), as well as urinary incontinence due to
      idiopathic overactive bladder (IDO). In both conditions, the duration of
      effect seems to be at least 6 months. Overall success rates seem to be
      similar in both patient populations. For NDO, only one evidence-based
      medicine level 1 study is available, whereas for IDO, only evidence-based
      medicine level 3 or 4 studies have been published. Particularly in this
      latter indication, injection technique and outcome parameters vary from
      study to study and need to be standardised. Without randomised controlled
      studies aimed at comparing different techniques and dosages, it remains
      difficult to decide what technique is optimal for treating patients with
      IDO who are not willing to perform clean intermittent self-catheterisation
      (CISC). Therefore, studies that compare different dosages and techniques
      with the risk of needing CISC in regard to the duration of the effect are
      mandatory. As more studies of repeated injections have been published, it
      appears that, at least at medium follow-up, the toxin remains as effective
      as after the first injection, and there is no evidence of change in
      bladder compliance or detrusor fibrosis. However, long-term observational
      studies are necessary to assess these last points. Finally, the commonly
      reported dose appears to be well tolerated, since few adverse effects have
      been reported.

TI  - Portal hypertensive enteropathy.
PG  - 277-86
AB  - The available data on the use of VCE in patients who have cirrhosis and
      portal hypertension are inadequate to reach a firm conclusion about the
      usefulness of this diagnostic tool in this patient population. In fact,
      only retrospective case series exist, in which the characteristics of the
      patients are heterogeneous in terms of severity of liver disease and of
      portal hypertension, etiology of cirrhosis, and indication for VCE. In
      addition, the controls included in the studies are heterogeneous or poorly
      described. In spite of this, it appears that in patients with portal
      hypertension, the small bowel frequently shows mucosal abnormalities. Such
      abnormalities appear to be particularly frequent in patients who have
      severe portal hypertension and in those with low hemoglobin levels. The
      clinical significance of these findings remains undefined, however,
      especially in view of the fact that small bowel lesions also have been
      found in about 10% of patients with arthritis not taking nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and in 13.8% of healthy subjects [41,42].
      Therefore,large prospective studies are needed to evaluate the prevalence
      and clinical significance of small bowel mucosal changes in patients who
      have cirrhosis. Such studies should compare patients who have cirrhosis
      with healthy subjects. A comparison between cirrhotic patients with a
      history of intestinal bleeding and bleeding patients without cirrhosis
      also would be interesting.

TI  - The genetics of ray pattern variation in Caenorhabditis briggsae.
PG  - 3
AB  - BACKGROUND: How does intraspecific variation relate to macroevolutionary
      change in morphology? This question can be addressed in species in which
      derived characters are present but not fixed. In rhabditid nematodes, the
      arrangement of the nine bilateral pairs of peripheral sense organs (rays)
      in tails of males is often the most highly divergent character between
      species. The development of ray pattern involves inputs from hometic gene
      expression patterns, TGFbeta signalling, Wnt signalling, and other genetic
      pathways. In Caenorhabditis briggsae, strain-specific variation in ray
      pattern has provided an entree into the evolution of ray pattern. Some
      strains were fixed for a derived pattern. Other strains were more plastic
      and exhibited derived and ancestral patterns at equal frequencies.
      RESULTS: Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) constructed from crosses between
      the variant C. briggsae AF16 and HK104 strains exhibited a wide range of
      phenotypes including some that were more extreme than either parental
      strain. Transgressive segregation was significantly associated with
      allelic variation in the C. briggsae homolog of abdominal B, Cb-egl-5. At
      least two genes that affected different elements of ray pattern, ray
      position and ray fusion, were linked to a second gene, mip-1. Consistent
      with this, the segregation of ray position and ray fusion phenotypes were
      only partially correlated in the RILs. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of ray
      pattern has involved allelic variation at multiple loci. Some of these
      loci impact the specification of ray identities and simultaneously affect
      multiple ray pattern elements. Others impact individual characters and are
      not constrained by covariance with other ray pattern elements. Among the
      genetic pathways that may be involved in ray pattern evolution is
      specification of anteroposterior positional information by homeotic genes.

TI  - The synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 increases COX-2 expression and PGE2
      release in murine brain-derived endothelial cells following Theiler's
      virus infection.
PG  - 869-80
AB  - Brain endothelial cells infection represents one of the first events in
      the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelination disease (TMEV-IDD), a model
      of multiple sclerosis (MS). The fact that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
      expression in brain endothelium mediates a wide variety of actions during
      CNS inflammatory diseases such as MS, and that cannabinoids ameliorate the
      progression of TMEV-IDD, lead us to investigate the role of cannabinoids
      on COX-2 expression on murine brain endothelial cell cultures subjected or
      not to TMEV infection. Murine brain endothelial cells (b.end5) express
      both cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. However, treatment of b.end5 with
      the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 resulted in up-regulation COX-2
      protein and PGE2 release by a mechanism independent on activation of these
      receptors. Other cannabinoids such as 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) or
      the abnormal cannabidiol (Abn-CBD) failed to affect COX-2 in our
      conditions. TMEV infection of murine brain endothelial cell cultures
      induced a significant increase of COX-2 expression at 8h, which was
      maintained even increased, at 20 and 32h post-infection. The combination
      of TMEV infection and Win 55,212-2 treatment increased COX-2 expression to
      a greater amount than was seen with either treatment alone. 2-AG and
      Abn-CBD did not modify COX-2 expression after TMEV. COX-2 synthesis
      involved different signaling pathways when was induced by WIN 55,212-2
      and/or by TMEV infection. WIN 55,212-2-induced COX-2 up-regulation
      involves the PI(3)K pathway, whereas COX-2 induction by TMEV needs p38
      MAPK activation too. Overexpression of COX-2 and the subsequent increase
      of PGE2 could be affecting flow blood and/or immune reactivity.

TI  - Independent [Ca2+]i increases and cell proliferation induced by the
      carcinogen safrole in human oral cancer cells.
PG  - 88-94
AB  - The effect of the carcinogen safrole on intracellular Ca2+ movement and
      cell proliferation has not been explored previously. The present study
      examined whether safrole could alter Ca2+ handling and growth in human
      oral cancer OC2 cells. Cytosolic free Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) in populations
      of cells were measured using fura-2 as a fluorescent Ca2+ probe. Safrole
      at a concentration of 325 microM started to increase [Ca2+]i in a
      concentration-dependent manner. The Ca2+ signal was reduced by 40% by
      removing extracellular Ca2+, and was decreased by 39% by nifedipine but
      not by verapamil or diltiazem. In Ca2+-free medium, after pretreatment
      with 650 microM safrole, 1 microM thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum
      Ca2+ pump inhibitor) barely induced a [Ca2+]i rise; in contrast, addition
      of safrole after thapsigargin treatment induced a small [Ca2+]i rise.
      Neither inhibition of phospholipase C with 2 microM U73122 nor modulation
      of protein kinase C activity affected safrole-induced Ca2+ release.
      Overnight incubation with 1 microM safrole did not alter cell
      proliferation, but incubation with 10-1000 microM safrole increased cell
      proliferation by 60+/-10%. This increase was not reversed by pre-chelating
      Ca2+ with 10 microM of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. Collectively, the data
      suggest that in human oral cancer cells, safrole induced a [Ca2+]i rise by
      causing release of stored Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum in a
      phospholipase C- and protein kinase C-independent fashion and by inducing
      Ca2+ influx via nifedipine-sensitive Ca2+ entry. Furthermore, safrole can
      enhance cell growth in a Ca2+-independent manner.

TI  - Atypical protein kinase C iota is an oncogene in human non-small cell lung
      cancer.
PG  - 8905-11
AB  - Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes have long been implicated in
      carcinogenesis. However, little is known about the functional significance
      of these enzymes in human cancer. We recently showed that the atypical PKC
      (aPKC) isozyme PKCiota is overexpressed in human non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) cells and that PKCiota plays a critical role in the
      transformed growth of the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line in
      vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Here we provide compelling evidence that
      PKCiota is an oncogene in NSCLC based on the following criteria: (a)
      aPKCiota is overexpressed in the vast majority of primary NSCLC tumors;
      (b) tumor PKCiota expression levels predict poor survival in patients with
      NSCLC; (c) the PKCiota gene is frequently amplified in established NSCLC
      cell lines and primary NSCLC tumors; (d) gene amplification drives PKCiota
      expression in NSCLC cell lines and primary NSCLC tumors; and (e)
      disruption of PKCiota signaling with a dominant negative PKCiota allele
      blocks the transformed growth of human NSCLC cells harboring PKCiota gene
      amplification. Taken together, our data provide conclusive evidence that
      PKCiota is required for the transformed growth of NSCLC cells and that the
      PKCiota gene is a target for tumor-specific genetic alteration by
      amplification. Interestingly, PKCiota expression predicts poor survival in
      NSCLC patients independent of tumor stage. Therefore, PKCiota expression
      profiling may be useful in identifying early-stage NSCLC patients at
      elevated risk of relapse. Our functional data indicate that PKCiota is an
      attractive target for development of novel, mechanism-based therapeutics
      to treat NSCLC.

TI  - Emergent stabilization of pelvic ring injuries by controlled
      circumferential compression: a clinical trial.
PG  - 659-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic ring injuries are associated with a high incidence of
      mortality mainly due to retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Early stabilization is
      an integral part of hemorrhage control. Temporary stabilization can be
      provided by a pelvic sheet, sling, or an inflatable garment. However,
      these devices lack control of the applied circumferential compression. We
      evaluated a pelvic circumferential compression device (PCCD), which allows
      for force-controlled circumferential compression. In a prospective
      clinical trial, we documented how this device can provide effective
      reduction of open-book type pelvic injuries without causing
      overcompression of lateral compression type injuries. METHODS: Sixteen
      patients with pelvic ring injuries were enrolled. Pelvic fractures were
      temporarily stabilized with a PCCD until definitive stabilization was
      provided. Anteroposterior pelvic radiographs were obtained before and
      after PCCD application, and after definitive stabilization. These
      radiographs were analyzed to quantify pelvic reduction due to the PCCD in
      comparison to the quality of reduction after definitive stabilization.
      Results were stratified into external rotation and internal rotation
      fracture patterns. RESULTS: In the external rotation group, the PCCD
      significantly reduced the pelvic width by 9.9 +/- 6.0%. This reduction
      closely approximated the 10.0 +/- 4.1% reduction in pelvic width achieved
      by definitive stabilization. In the internal rotation group, the PCCD did
      not cause significant overcompression. No complications were observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: A PCCD can effectively reduce pelvic ring injuries. It poses
      a minimal risk for overcompression and complications as compared with
      reduction alternatives that do not provide a feedback on the applied
      reduction force.

AB  - Enantioselective quantification of amphetamine (AM), methamphetamine (MA),
      3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
      (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA) enantiomers in hair
      using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is described. Hair
      specimens were digested with 1M sodium hydroxide at 100 degrees C for 30
      min and extracted by a solid phase procedure using Cleanscreen ZSDAU020.
      Extracted analytes were derivatised with (S)-heptafluorobutyrylprolyl
      chloride and the resulting diastereoisomers were quantified by GC-MS
      operating in the negative chemical ionization mode. Extraction yields were
      between 73.0 and 97.9%. Limits of detection varied in the range of
      2.1-45.9 pg/mg hair, whereas the lowest limits of quantification varied
      between 4.3 and 91.8 pg/mg hair. Intra- and inter-assay precision and
      respective accuracy were acceptable. The enantiomeric ratios (R versus S)
      of AM, MA, MDA, MDMA and MDEA were determined in hair from suspected
      amphetamine abusers. Only MA and AM enantiomers were detectable in this
      collective and the quantification data showed in most cases higher
      concentrations of (R)-MA and (R)-AM than those of the corresponding
      (S)-enantiomers.

TI  - Smokeless tobacco impairs the antioxidant defense in liver, lung, and
      kidney of rats.
PG  - 547-53
AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of long-term use of
      aqueous extract of gutkha (a form of smokeless tobacco) on the antioxidant
      defense status and histopathological changes in liver, lung, and kidney of
      male Wistar rats. Animals were orally administered aqueous extract of
      smokeless tobacco (AEST) at a low dose (96 mg/kg body weight per day) for
      2 and 32 weeks, and at a high dose (960 mg/kg body weight per day) for 2
      weeks. High-dose AEST for 2 weeks decreased the hepatic glutathione (GSH)
      and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and increased lipid peroxidation (Lpx)
      by 17%, 19%, and 20%, respectively. Low-dose AEST for 32 weeks
      significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the antioxidant status in these organs.
      In liver, AEST decreased GSH levels and the activities of superoxide
      dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and GPx by 34.6%, 29%, 17.1%, and 17.4%,
      respectively, but it increased Lpx by 64%. In kidney, GSH, SOD, CAT, and
      GPx were decreased by 26.6%, 23%, 33%, and 18%, respectively, with an
      increase of Lpx by 65%. AEST decreased the lung GSH, SOD, CAT, and GPx,
      and increased lung Lpx by 43%, 28.5%, 37%, 40%, and 24%, respectively.
      However, no change in the plasma levels of vitamins A, C, and E were
      observed with AEST treatment. Histopathological findings suggest that
      administration of AEST at the high dose for 2 weeks or at the low dose for
      32 weeks could cause mild to moderate inflammation in liver and lungs. In
      conclusion, a decrease in the antioxidant defense system and long-term
      inflammation caused by smokeless tobacco may be risk factors for
      gutkha-induced pathogenesis.

TI  - Effects of a thermal-insulating mouse pad on temperature of forearm and
      hand during computer tasks.
PG  - 822-31
AB  - This laboratory experiment studied the effects of a thermal-insulating
      mouse pad on arm temperature and comfort during computer work. Fourteen
      subjects performed two 20-min computer tasks (a mouse task and a combined
      task alternating keyboard and mouse use), under three conditions, namely
      with: 1) a thermal-insulating pad; 2) a placebo pad; 3) no pad (desktop).
      The temperatures of the forearm, wrist, hand and fingers were measured
      with four thermocouples. Comfort and discomfort were determined by two
      visual analogue scales. No arm temperature differences were found between
      the experimental conditions after performing the combination task in any
      location. After the mouse task, however, arm temperature decreased
      significantly less with the thermal-insulating mouse pad than with the
      placebo pad. The thermal-insulating pad was rated as more comfortable and
      less uncomfortable than a regular desktop during mouse tasks. A large size
      is recommended for the thermal-insulating pad.

TI  - Efficacy of fetal echocardiography and an evaluation of indications.
PG  - S215-20
AB  - Fetal echocardiography has been accepted as a prenatal noninvasive
      diagnostic tool of cardiovascular diseases in fetuses for more than three
      decades. There are limited data in Thailand. A retrospective study of
      prenatal, natal and postnatal data of pregnant women who had fetal
      echocardiography at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, from January 1999
      to July 2005 was conducted. In total, there were 117 pregnant women who
      had fetal echocardiography under standard indications. Median age of
      pregnant women was 30.2 (17.3-44.2) years old. Median gestational age at
      the first fetal echocardiography was 29 (17-40) weeks. Median number of
      time the women had fetal echocardiography was 1 (1-10). Indications for
      fetal echocardiography were; obstetricians suspected of fetal
      cardiovascular diseases, multiple anomalies, family history of congenital
      heart diseases, chromosome anomalies, hydrops fetalis, and other
      indications (53.8%, 12%, 11.1%, 8.5%, 8.5% and 6.0% respectively). There
      were 49 (41.8%) cases who had abnormal cardiovascular problems, i.e.,
      structural heart diseases 26 cases, rhythm disturbance 15 cases, and
      cardiac masses 8 cases. Upon comparison with postnatal echocardiography
      and/or autopsy findings, fetal echocardiography had a sensitivity of
      96.9%, specificity of 90.6%, and accuracy of 92.8%. There was various
      degrees of risk to have cardiovascular problems for each of the indication
      taking fetal echocardiography and postnatal data into consideration. Fetal
      echocardiography had an impact on the management in 57.3% of cases.
      Conclusion: Fetal echocardiography is a reliable prenatal diagnostic tool
      for cardiovascular problems with high accuracy and has an impact on the
      management at prenatal, natal and postnatal period. Different indications
      for fetal echocardiography have an effect on the relative risk of fetal
      cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Food intolerance and chronic constipation: manometry and histology study.
PG  - 143-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic constipation in children can be caused by cows' milk
      intolerance (CMI), but its pathogenesis is unknown. AIMS: To evaluate the
      histology and manometry pattern in patients with food intolerance-related
      constipation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive children with
      chronic constipation were enrolled. All underwent an elimination diet and
      successive double-blind food challenge. All underwent rectal biopsy and
      anorectal manometry. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients were found to be
      suffering from CMI and three from multiple food intolerance. They had a
      normal stool frequency on elimination diet, whereas constipation recurred
      on food challenge. The patients with food intolerance showed a
      significantly higher frequency of erosions of the mucosa, and the number
      of intra-epithelial lymphocytes and eosinophils. The rectal mucous gel
      layer showed that the food-intolerant patients had a significantly lower
      thickness of mucus than the other subjects studied. Manometry showed a
      higher anal sphincter resting pressure and a lower critical volume in food
      intolerance patients than in the others suffering from constipation
      unrelated to food intolerance. Both histology and manometry abnormalities
      disappeared on the elimination diet. CONCLUSIONS: Food intolerance-related
      constipation is characterized by proctitis. Increased anal resting
      pressure and a reduced mucous gel layer can be considered to be
      contributory factors in the pathogenesis of constipation.

TI  - Nicotine induces conditioned place preferences over a large range of doses
      in rats.
PG  - 481-92
AB  - RATIONALE: Conditioned place preference (CPP) procedures provide one
      measure of potential rewarding effects of abused drugs. Many attempts to
      induce CPP with nicotine have been unsuccessful. OBJECTIVES: To assess the
      influence of nicotine dose and stimulus assignment procedure on
      development of nicotine-induced CPP. METHODS: Initial preferences for one
      side of a two-compartment apparatus were first determined in
      Sprague-Dawley rats. In subsequent conditioning trials, the compartment
      paired with nicotine was the initially preferred side for half of the
      rats, and the initially non-preferred side for the other half. Rats
      received either an injection of nicotine (0.01-2 mg/kg SC) before being
      placed in one compartment (three trials) or saline before being placed in
      the other compartment (three trials). Control rats had saline injections
      associated with both compartments. A final test trial with no injection
      assessed final place preference. RESULTS: Significant CPP were induced by
      0.1-1.4 mg/kg doses of nicotine. Nicotine-induced CPP were only apparent
      when nicotine was paired with the initially non-preferred side. Moreover,
      a very high dose of nicotine (2 mg/kg) induced conditioned place aversion
      when paired with the initially preferred side of the apparatus.
      CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine induced significant CPP across a wide range of
      doses, in accordance with its role as the primary addictive component of
      tobacco. Small preferences for one side of the apparatus played a major
      role in the development of nicotine-induced CPP. These findings suggest
      that biased procedures may be more suitable than unbiased procedures for
      evaluation of rewarding effects of nicotine using CPP paradigms.

TI  - Genetic and environmental determinants of bone mineral density in Chinese
      women.
PG  - 700-9
AB  - BMD is a complex trait determined by genetic and lifestyle factors. To
      assess the genetic and environmental determinants of BMD in southern
      Chinese women, we studied a community-based cohort of 531 pre- and
      postmenopausal southern Chinese women and assessed the influence of 12
      candidate gene loci and lifestyle risk factors on spine and hip BMD. The
      candidate genes studied include estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and beta
      (ESR2), calcium sensing receptor (CASR), vitamin D receptor (VDR),
      collagen type Ialpha1 (COLIA1), and LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5).
      Social, medical, reproductive history, dietary habits and lifestyle
      factors were determined using a structured questionnaire. Single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the COLIA1 and LRP5 gene in Chinese
      were determined by direct sequencing. Nucleotide (nt) -1363C/G and -1997
      G/T of COLIA1, nt 266A/G, 2220C/T and 3989C/T of LRP5 gene were analyzed.
      Using stepwise multiple linear regression analyses, body weight was the
      strongest predictor for BMD in premenopausal women (n = 262), which
      accounted for 15.9% of the variance at the spine, 20% at femoral neck,
      17.1% at trochanter, 24.3% at total hip and 10.9% at the Ward's triangle.
      Other significant predictors were ESR1 Ivs1-397T/C genotype (2.2% at the
      spine); LRP5 2220C/T genotype (1.3% at the spine, 1.6% at the trochanter);
      LRP5 266A/G genotype (1.1% at Ward's triangle); age at menarche (1.3% at
      trochanter) and age (2.0% at Ward's triangle). As for postmenopausal women
      (n = 269), body weight ( approximately 25% at various sites) and age
      (approximately 16% at femoral neck, trochanter, total hip and Ward's
      triangle sites) were the strongest predictors of BMD. Other significant
      predictors were age at menarche (4.4% at spine, 0.7% at femoral neck, 1.4%
      at trochanter, and 1.4% at Ward's triangle); weight bearing physical
      activity (2.1% at trochanter and 1% at total hip); calcium intake (1.1% at
      femoral neck, 0.9% at trochanter, and 1.7% at total hip) ; height (0.7% at
      trochanter); and ESR2 1082A/G genotype (0.8% at trochanter). We conclude
      that BMD at various sites and at different time span of a woman is
      modified by different genetic and lifestyle factors, suggesting that BMD
      is highly dependent on gene-environmental interactions.

TI  - [Sequential treatment of VmP regimen and whole brain radiotherapy for
      small cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases].
PG  - 1671-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Median survival time (MST) of small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC) patients with brain metastases was short when patients were
      palliatively treated with either chemotherapy or whole brain radiotherapy
      (WBRT). This study was designed to compare therapeutic
      effects,toxicities,and survival time of 2 different sequential treatments
      of VmP regimen and WBRT for SCLC patients with brain metastases. METHODS:
      According to bed availability, 38 naive SCLC patients with brain
      metastases were nonrandomized into group A and group B. There was no
      significant difference of characteristics between 2 groups (Chi-s Fisher's
      exact test, P >0.05). Patients in group A (VmP-WBRT) received 2 cycles of
      VmP regimen (teniposide, 60 mg/m(2),d(1-5), cisplatin, 25 mg/m(2), d(1-3),
      repeated every 4 weeks),and then WBRT (3 Gy x 10,within 2 weeks); patients
      in group B (WBRT-VmP) received the same WBRT in advance,and then 2 cycles
      of VmP regimen. Patients with single brain lesion received an extra 3 Gy x
      5 radiotherapy on the limited field of brain lesion within 1 week after
      WBRT. All patients received 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy after sequential
      treatments. RESULTS: Both sequential treatments relieved neurological
      symptoms of more than 80% of patients. Response rates of brain,lung,and
      total lesions of group A and B had no significant differences (68.2% vs.
      75.0%, P=0.647; 77.3% vs. 75%, P=0.871; 63.6% vs. 56.3%,
      P=0.646,respectively). Time to progression (TTP) of group A was 6.0 (95%
      CI 4.4-7.6) months,of group B was 5.0 (95% CI 3.6-6.4) months (P=0.383).
      MST of group A was 12.0 (95% CI 7.9-16.1) months,of group B was 9.0 (95%
      CI 5.6-12.4) months (P=0.049). One-year survival rate of group A was
      31.8%,of group B was 18.8% (P=0.281),and 2-year survival rates were 13.6%,
      and 6.3% (P=0.844). Myelosuppression was the main concentration-dependent
      toxicity. Incidence of vomit at stage III in group B was higher than that
      in group A (P=0.01). All treatment toxicities were tolerable and
      manageable. CONCLUSION: Both sequential treatments can be safely performed
      for SCLC patients with brain metastases, may relieve neurological
      symptoms, and well control both primary and metastatic lesions. VmP-WBRT
      sequential treatment may prolong survival time of SCLC patients for 3
      months.

TI  - Supranodose vagotomy eliminates anandamide-evoked cardiorespiratory
      depression in anaesthetized rats.
PG  - 143-51
AB  - Respiratory effects of an intravenous injection of anandamide were
      investigated in 19 urethane-chloralose anaesthetised and spontaneously
      breathing rats. In 10 neurally intact rats the effects of anandamide were
      checked to establish appropriate dose of the drug. In the second group,
      nine rats were challenged with anandamide while intact, following
      bilateral midcervical vagotomy and after subsequent supranodose vagotomy.
      Bolus injection of 1 mg kg(-1) of anandamide into the right femoral vein
      pre- and post-midcervical vagotomy induced in all nine rats prompt apnoea
      of similar duration: 2.97 +/- 0.5 and 3.2 +/- 0.4s, respectively. In
      post-apnoeic breaths tidal volume decreased below the control level by 25%
      (P < 0.01) prior to and by 43.4% (P < 0.001) after midcervical vagotomy.
      Supranodose vagotomy precluded the respiratory response to anandamide.
      Anandamide-induced decrease in mean arterial blood pressure in
      nerve-intact and vagotomised rats was abolished by supranodose vagotomy.
      Results indicate that the cardio-respiratory depression evoked by
      anandamide administered via the peripheral circulation requires intact
      supranodose vagi.

TI  - Total thyroidectomy replaces subtotal thyroidectomy as the preferred
      surgical treatment for Graves' disease.
PG  - 528-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total thyroidectomy is increasingly being adopted for patients
      requiring surgical treatment for Graves' disease based on a comparable
      surgical risk and the lack of recurrence, as well as the questionable
      ability of subtotal thyroidectomy to maintain euthyroidism. The purpose of
      the present paper was to evaluate its safety and efficiency. METHODS:
      Total thyroidectomy was adopted as part of the routine surgical treatment
      for Graves' disease from 2000. Patients who underwent subtotal
      thyroidectomy (STT) from 1995 to 1999 (n = 119) were compared with those
      who underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) from 2000 to 2003 (n = 98) with
      respect to immediate postoperative morbidity and long-term outcome.
      RESULTS: Fourteen (11.8%) and 22 patients (22.4%) required calcium
      supplement on discharge in the STT and TT groups, respectively (P < 0.05).
      One (0.8%) and three patients (3.1%) developed permanent hypocalcaemia,
      respectively. Transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy occurred in 9.2%
      (n = 11) and 5.1% (n = 5) of patients or 5.0% and 2.6% of nerves at risk
      after STT and TT, respectively. None of the patients had permanent nerve
      palsy. The estimated blood loss was less and hospital stay shorter after
      TT. During a mean follow up of 64 months, 86 patients (72.3%) in the STT
      group required thyroxine replacement and seven patients (5.9%) developed
      relapse. CONCLUSION: Subtotal thyroidectomy was associated with relapse as
      well as hypothyroidism in a significant proportion of patients during
      long-term follow up. Total thyroidectomy can be performed as safely as STT
      and should be recommended as the procedure of choice for patients
      requiring surgical treatment for Graves' disease.

TI  - Load-sensitive measures may overestimate global systolic function in the
      presence of left ventricular hypertrophy: a comparison with
      load-insensitive measures.
PG  - H1699-705
AB  - Transgenic animal models have provided a vital insight into the
      pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, but functional cardiac assessment
      is often limited by high heart rates and small heart size. We hypothesized
      that in the presence of concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy
      (LVH), load-sensitive measures of contractility may be misinterpreted as
      overestimating global cardiac function, because the normal function of
      excess sarcomeres may displace a greater volume of blood during
      contraction. Conductance catheter technology was used to evaluate
      pressure-volume (P-V) relationships as a load-insensitive method of
      assessing cardiac function in vivo in 18-wk-old heterozygous (mRen-2)27
      transgenic rats (a model of LVH), compared with age-matched Sprague-Dawley
      (SD) controls. Anesthetized animals underwent echocardiography followed by
      P-V loop analysis. Blood pressure, body weight, and heart rate were higher
      in the Ren-2 rats (P < 0.05). Load-sensitive measures of systolic
      function, including fractional area change, fractional shortening,
      ejection fraction, and positive peak rate of LV pressure development, were
      greater in the Ren-2 than control animals (P < 0.05). Load-insensitive
      measures of systolic function, including the preload recruitable stroke
      work relationship and the end-systolic P-V relationship, were not
      different between Ren-2 and SD rats. Regional wall motion assessed by
      circumferential shortening velocity suggested enhanced circumferential
      fiber contractility in the Ren-2 rats (P = 0.02), but tissue Doppler
      imaging, used to assess longitudinal function, was not different between
      groups. Although conventional measures suggested enhanced systolic
      function in the Ren-2 rat, load-insensitive measures of contractility were
      not different between Ren-2 and SD animals. These findings suggest that
      the normal range of values for load-sensitive indexes of contractility
      needs to be altered according to the degree of LVH. To accurately identify
      changes in systolic function, we suggest that a combination of
      echocardiography with assessment of load-insensitive measures be used
      routinely.

TI  - Effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist on smooth muscle cell
      phenotype in intramyocardial arteries from spontaneously hypertensive
      rats.
PG  - 685-93
AB  - To clarify the precise mechanisms involved in the reduced coronary flow
      reserve in hypertension, we compared the effects of the angiotensin II
      type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist FK-739 with those of the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril for 6 weeks on the
      smooth muscle (SM) cell phenotype in intramyocardial arteries from male
      Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).
      Compared with WKY, SHR showed a significant increase in left ventricular
      (LV) hypertrophy and fibrosis, blood pressure (BP), and vascular
      remodeling of the intramyocardial arteries, and a significant decrease in
      endothelial NO synthase and the contractile-type myosin heavy chain
      isoform SM2 of the intramyocardial arteries as well as calponin 1 and
      GATA-6. In the hearts of SHR, both drugs equivalently and significantly
      reduced BP, which was still significantly higher than that in the WKY
      groups, and also reduced LV hypertrophy and fibrosis, whereas endothelial
      NO synthase was significantly restored. Although both drugs showed little
      effect on the vascular remodeling of the intramyocardial arteries in the
      SHR hearts, FK-739, but not enalapril, significantly restored SM2 and
      GATA-6 in the SHR hearts to the same levels as those of the vehicle WKY
      group. The effects of the two drugs on these indices were not observed in
      the three WKY hearts. Thus, the AT1 receptor antagonist may modulate the
      SM cell phenotype toward the contractile-type more effectively than the
      ACE inhibitor before the morphological changes occur in the
      intramyocardial arteries of the SHR hearts.

TI  - The oral glucose tolerance test is frequently abnormal in patients with
      uncontrolled epilepsy.
PG  - 140-4
AB  - PURPOSE: The clinical efficacy of the ketogenic diet as therapy for
      patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsy prompted us to investigate the
      glucose metabolism of these patients under an oral overload of glucose,
      that is, in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). METHODS: Thirty
      patients (12 males, 18 females; age range: 17-59, mean: 35.1) with
      difficult-to-treat epilepsy, 23 patients with controlled epilepsy (11
      males, 12 females; age range: 14-66, mean: 36.9), and 39 control subjects
      (18 males, 21 females; age range: 16-58, mean: 33.3) were evaluated with
      the OGTT. For patients with epilepsy, we also measured C-peptide and
      glycosylated hemoglobin in the fasting state. Glucose levels lower than 70
      mg/dL at any point of the curve were considered to be abnormal. RESULTS:
      All subjects in the control group and the group with controlled epilepsy
      had a normal OGTT. In contrast, all 30 patients with difficult-to-treat
      epilepsy had at least one point on the OGTT curve below the normal range
      (P<0.001), most often 180 and 240 minutes after the oral glucose load
      (P<0.001). C-peptide levels were significantly lower in the group with
      difficult-to-treat epilepsy as compared with the group with controlled
      epilepsy. Fasting glycohemoglobin and insulin levels did not differ
      between the two patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that undiagnosed
      metabolic disturbances in patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsy may
      somehow contribute to their refractoriness to conventional pharmacological
      therapy. We propose the hypothesis that calorie-restricted diets aimed at
      correcting OGTT curves may prove beneficial in treating patients with
      difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Our hypothesis generates a clear endpoint for
      the diet, and its demonstration would provide new standards for diet-based
      antiepileptic regimens. Accordingly, our results may help in understanding
      the positive consequences of ketogenic or calorie-restricted diets in
      persons with seizures.

TI  - Malignant smooth muscle tumours of soft tissue--a demographic and
      clinicopathological study at a tertiary care hospital.
PG  - 138-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the demographic characteristics and distribution
      of various reported prognostic factors of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) among
      subjects reporting to histopathology diagnostic centers of Aga Khan
      University (AKU) all over Pakistan between 2000-2004. METHODS: This study
      analyzed 205 consecutive confirmed cases of LMS received during a period
      of four years. The data regarding age, sex and size of tumor was obtained
      from the pathology medical records. Data on grade and positivity of
      immunohistochemical stains was assessed and all the variables analyzed
      using SPSS version 12.5. RESULTS: Of the 205 specimens of LMS, 31 were
      received as blocks for second opinion. A hundred specimens were multiple
      fragments, and 74 were intact masses. Of the latter, 40% had clear
      margins. The mean size of the tumor was 7.23 cms. (95% CI 6.1; 8.4). There
      were no cases of childhood LMS. Teenage LMS comprised 3% of all tumors.
      Grade 1 tumors were 16.6% of the total, 56.6% were grade 2, and 8.5% were
      grade 3. Vimentin positivity was observed in 97% of the tumors, desmin
      positivity in 56.7%, HHF35 positivity in 81.0%, s-100 positivity in 15.6%
      and cytokeratin positivity in 11% of the cases. The median age of LMS
      patients was 48.4 years, the mean age was 48.6 years (95% CI 45.9; 50.8)
      and male to female ratio was 1:1.2. The malignancy occurred a decade
      earlier in the females as compared to the males. The mean age of male
      cases was 52.3 years (95% CI 48.8; 55.8); and of females was 45.2 years
      (95% CI 41.8; 48.6). The mean age of teenage LMS was 17.2 years (95% CI
      15.6; 18.7). The most common symptom was a painless swelling. The most
      common sites were lower limb (24.4%) and pelvis (24.4%) followed by
      abdomen (20.6%) and head and neck (12.7%). The least common sites were
      upper limb and chest (8.0% each). Seventy five percent of the tumors with
      involved margins were more than 5.0 cms. in size whereas 47% of tumors
      with free margins were above 5.0 cms. in size. Approximately half the
      tumors in the males were less than 5.0 cms, as compared with 31.0% in the
      females. LMS in the extremities was equally common in both genders, but
      trunk LMS was nearly twice as common in the females. CONCLUSION: In our
      population, leiomyosarcoma occurs at a relatively younger age, has a late
      presentation; is more common in females as compared to males and usually
      excised incompletely. No genetic study for LMS has been published in
      Pakistan; these studies are recommended to determine the biological
      pattern of LMS in our population.

TI  - Rituximab-CHOP versus CHOP alone or with maintenance rituximab in older
      patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
PG  - 3121-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To address early and late treatment failures in older patients
      with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we designed a two-stage
      randomized trial of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
      prednisone (CHOP) versus rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP), with a second
      random assignment to maintenance rituximab (MR) or observation in
      responding patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Untreated DLBCL patients who
      were 60 years or older were randomly assigned to R-CHOP (n = 318) or CHOP
      (n = 314); 415 responders were randomly assigned to MR (n = 207) or
      observation (n = 208). The primary end point was failure-free survival
      (FFS). All P values were two sided. RESULTS: Three-year FFS rate was 53%
      for R-CHOP patients and 46% for CHOP patients (P = .04) at a median
      follow-up time of 3.5 years. Two-year FFS rate from second random
      assignment was 76% for MR compared with 61% for observation (P = .009). No
      significant differences in survival were seen according to induction or
      maintenance therapy. FFS was prolonged with MR after CHOP (P = .0004) but
      not after R-CHOP (P = .81) with 2-year FFS rates from second random
      assignment of 77%, 79%, 74%, and 45% for R-CHOP, R-CHOP + MR, CHOP + MR,
      and CHOP, respectively. In a secondary analysis excluding MR patients,
      R-CHOP alone reduced the risks of treatment failure (P = .003) and death
      (P = .05) compared with CHOP alone. CONCLUSION: Rituximab administered as
      induction or maintenance with CHOP chemotherapy significantly prolonged
      FFS in older DLBCL patients. After R-CHOP, no benefit was provided by MR.
      These results, which are consistent with an additive effect of rituximab,
      suggest that future studies could focus on maintenance strategies with
      novel agents as well as new induction therapies.

TI  - CCM2 expression parallels that of CCM1.
PG  - 518-23
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mutations in CCM2 (MGC4607 or malcavernin) cause
      familial cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM), an autosomal dominant
      neurovascular disease. Both the function of this molecule and the
      pathogenesis of the disease remain elusive. METHODS: We analyzed the mRNA
      expression of Ccm1 and Ccm2 in the embryonic and postnatal mouse brain by
      in situ hybridization. Subsequently, we generated CCM2-specific polyclonal
      antibodies and tested their specificity using transient transfection
      experiments in various cell lines. We then investigated CCM2 protein
      expression in cerebral and extracerebral tissues by Western blot analysis
      as well as immunohistochemistry and compared these results with CCM1
      (KRIT1) protein expression. RESULTS: In situ analysis shows similar
      temporal and spatial expression patterns for Ccm1 and Ccm2, although Ccm1
      expression appears more widespread. Immunohistochemical analysis shows
      that CCM2 is expressed in various human organs, most noticeably in the
      arterial vascular endothelium. As is the case with CCM1, CCM2 is not
      expressed in other vascular wall elements such as smooth muscle cells or
      the venous circulation. Within cerebral tissue, it is also expressed in
      pyramidal neurons, astrocytes, and their foot processes. In extracerebral
      tissues, CCM2 is present in various epithelial cells necessary for
      blood-organ barrier formation. CONCLUSIONS: CCM1 and CCM2 have similar
      expression patterns during development and postnatally thereafter. Given
      the fact that the disease phenotypes caused by mutations in either gene
      are clinically and pathologically indistinguishable, the significant
      overlap in expression pattern supports the hypothesis that both molecules
      are involved in the same pathway important for central nervous system
      vascular development.

TI  - Maze III replication using radiofrequency microbipolar coagulation.
PG  - 139-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: The major concerns about the Cox's Maze III procedure have
      been the long bypass and cross-clamp times involved. We have developed a
      technique using microbipolar coagulation to duplicate most of the
      incisions described in the Maze III procedure. TECHNIQUE: This procedure
      is performed using standard hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and cold
      sanguineous hyperkalemic arrest. The left atrial Maze is performed using
      microbipolar coagulation following repair or following valve excision,
      prior to replacement. Cryolesions are used instead of radiofrequency at
      the mitral annulus to avoid injury to the circumflex coronary artery.
      Valve replacement is then done and the left atriotomies are closed. After
      rewarming, adequate deairing and removal of the aortic cross-clamp, the
      right atrial procedure is performed using microbipolar coagulation except
      ends of the radiofrequency lesion lines at the tricuspid annulus, where
      cryolesions are used. The rest of the surgery proceeds as usual. We used
      this procedure concomitantly with valve surgery in 84 patients. Sinus
      rhythm was restored in 86% of them. CONCLUSIONS: The use of radiofrequency
      energy in the microbipolar mode is safe and effective. The technique is
      easily reproducible and the tools involved are inexpensive and readily
      available. Although the cure rate is less compared to Cox's Maze III
      procedure and there is an attrition rate, sinus rhythm and atrial
      mechanical function is restored in the majority and with brief additional
      operative time.

TI  - Two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus complicated with colonic ulcers.
PG  - 1298-306
AB  - We report two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated with
      colonic ulcerations. One patient was successfully cured by steroid
      therapy, while the other did not respond to steroid but oral mesalazine
      was effective. Systemic lupus erythematosus is frequently accompanied by
      gastrointestinal symptoms, but colonic lesions are quite rare, and the
      regular treatment is not fixed yet. The high-dose steroidal regimen may be
      effective for microvasculitis, although it may increase the risk of
      perforated ulcer of the intestinal tract, which is a life-threatening
      complication. Further analysis of its outcomes, and establishment of the
      regular guideline for its treatment are expected.

TI  - Deficit in decision making in catatonic schizophrenia: an exploratory
      study.
PG  - 131-41
AB  - Catatonic schizophrenia can be distinguished from paranoid schizophrenia
      by prominent behavioral and motor anomalies. As demonstrated in recent
      imaging studies, behavioral symptoms may be related to dysfunction in the
      ventral prefrontal cortex. However, the neuropsychological correlates of
      ventral prefrontal cortical dysfunction remain unclear. In an exploratory
      study, we investigated eight patients with catatonic schizophrenia and
      compared them with 19 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 26 healthy
      subjects. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Object Alternation Task
      (OAT) served as measures of ventral prefrontal cortical function. In
      addition, other prefrontal cortical tests such as a visual working memory
      task, a Go-NoGo task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, as well as
      attentional tasks, were included in the test battery. Catatonic patients
      showed significant deficits in the IGT characterized by an inability to
      shift from the initial preference for high-risk cards to a more
      advantageous strategy with low-risk cards. Moreover, catatonic patients
      showed significant deficits in the OAT. In conclusion, our preliminary
      results suggest a specific deficit in catatonic schizophrenia in those
      neuropsychological measures that are associated with ventral prefrontal
      cortical function.

      based on an epoxy-enhanced polyurethane membrane.
PG  - 2275-82
AB  - This paper describes the preparation method as well as the in vitro and in
      vivo evaluation of a novel flexible glucose biosensor designed for
      long-term subcutaneous implantation. An epoxy-enhanced polyurethane
      membrane, which includes ca. 30-40% epoxy resin adhesive and 50-70%
      polyurethane, has been developed and used for the first time as the outer
      protective membrane of the sensor. This new membrane was developed to
      increase the in vivo durability and lifetime of implantable biosensors.
      This epoxy-polyurethane membrane was shown to be porous and is of
      excellent durability. A sensor with such a membrane shows excellent
      long-term stability and can last for 4-8 months in solutions at room
      temperature. To verify the in vivo performance of the sensor, nine sensors
      were implanted in three rats and tested regularly. Eight sensors kept
      functioning well in the rats for 10-56 days. The ninth sensor was damaged
      during implantation. All original sensitivity data as well as four
      response curves obtained at days 7, 17, 52 and 56, respectively are
      presented.

      aliphatic amines in oligonucleotides. The linearity was improved by
      including ammonia in the sample vials. Also, carryover of longer chain
      primary amines, hexylamine and octylamine, was substantially reduced by
      cleaning the injection syringe with ammonia and water vapor between sample
      injections.

TI  - 18F-FDG PET and CT/MRI in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma: a
      prospective study of 124 patients with histologic correlation.
PG  - 1136-43
AB  - Accurate evaluation of primary tumors and cervical lymph node status of
      squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity is important to treatment
      planning and prognosis prediction. In this prospective study, we evaluated
      the use of 18F-FDG PET, CT/MRI, and their visual correlation for the
      identification of primary tumors and cervical nodal metastases of SCC of
      the oral cavity with histologic correlation. METHODS: One hundred
      twenty-four patients with pathologically proven diagnoses of oral cavity
      SCC underwent 18F-FDG PET and CT/MRI within 2 wk before surgery. We
      interpreted 18F-FDG PET, CT/MRI, and visually correlated 18F-FDG PET and
      CT/MRI separately to assess the primary tumors and their regional lymph
      node status. We recorded lymph node metastases according to the neck level
      system of imaging-based nodal classification. Histopathologic analysis was
      used as the gold standard for assessment of the primary tumors and lymph
      node involvement. We analyzed differences in sensitivity and specificity
      among the imaging modalities using the McNemar test. The
      receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve and calculation of the area
      under the curve were used to evaluate their discriminative power. RESULTS:
      The accuracy of 18F-FDG PET, CT/MRI, and their visual correlation for the
      identification of primary tumors was 98.4%, 87.1%, and 99.2%,
      respectively. The sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET for the identification of
      nodal metastases on a level-by-level basis was 22.1% higher than that of
      CT/MRI (74.7% vs. 52.6%, P < 0.001), whereas the specificity of 18F-FDG
      PET was 1.5% lower than that of CT/MRI (93.0% vs. 94.5%, P = 0.345). The
      sensitivity and specificity of the visual correlation of 18F-FDG PET and
      CT/MRI were 3.2% and 1.5% higher than those of 18F-FDG PET alone (77.9%
      vs. 74.7%, P = 0.25; 94.5% vs. 93.0%, P = 0.18, respectively). The area
      under the curve obtained from the ROC curve showed that 18F-FDG PET was
      significantly superior to CT/MRI for total nodal detection (0.896 vs.
      0.801, P = 0.002), whereas the visual correlation of 18F-FDG PET and
      CT/MRI was modestly superior to 18F-FDG PET alone (0.913 vs. 0.896, P =
      0.28). CONCLUSION: 18F-FDG PET is superior to CT/MRI in the detection of
      cervical status of oral cavity SCC. The sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET for the
      detection of cervical nodal metastasis on a level-by-level basis was
      significantly higher than that of CT/MRI, whereas their specificities
      appeared to be similar. Visual correlation of 18F-FDG PET and CT/MRI
      showed a trend of increased diagnostic accuracy over 18F-FDG PET alone but
      without a statistically significant difference, and its sensitivity was
      still not high enough to replace pathologic lymph node staging based on
      neck dissection.

TI  - [A new method for standardized diagnosis following renal transplantation.
      Ultrasound with contrast enhancement].
PG  - 38-45
AB  - Ultrasound (US) imaging is an important diagnostic tool following renal
      transplantation. Unfortunately, due to the heterogeneity of the recipients
      and their multimorbidity, imaging procedures in the early phase after
      kidney transplantation are difficult and of limited use. We performed a
      study to evaluate the use of a contrast enhancer for US examination as a
      standardized method in the follow-up of kidney transplant recipients.The
      study included 40 recipients: 32 were examined on the 5th to 7th day
      following transplantation and 8 patients at the time when clinically
      suspicious findings occurred (acute rejection, tumor, acute tubular
      necrosis). Following the intravenous application of the contrast medium,
      pictures were taken during the arterial and parenchymatous phase and
      compared with conventional B-mode and power Doppler pictures of the same
      visual plane. Three examiners assessed different parameters of the
      transplant organ (max. vascularized area, suspected hematomas, tumors,
      rejection, acute tubular necrosis). Findings were confirmed by
      histological results of a biopsy if rejection, tumor, or acute tubular
      necrosis were suspected. Application of ultrasound contrast medium
      significantly increased visualization of the vascularized kidney area.
      Also, US findings in the follow-up after acute rejection therapy
      corresponded with the clinical course; 19 hematomas could be detected with
      contrast medium compared to only 9 without. With contrast medium a
      perfusion deficit was detectable in three patients compared to one patient
      with power Doppler US. Also, US contrast medium helped to detect tumor
      vascularization in two patients in whom conventional sonography suspected
      no abnormality. Ultrasound contrast medium enhancement is a reproducible,
      reliable, and easy to apply method which is superior to conventional
      sonography in the follow-up after kidney transplantation. This method is
      also helpful to detect and control acute rejections and to better
      visualize hematomas, deficits of perfusion, and tumors.

TI  - Therapeutic targets of misguided T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 295-8
AB  - It is widely accepted that T cells with defective function play a central
      role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The
      detailed molecular mechanism underlying the aberrant function of SLE T
      cells is now being revealed. The TCR zeta chain, transcription factor,
      elf-1, inflammation signal transducer NF-kB, and PKC theta have been
      identified as the responsible molecules. In contrast to the defective
      signal transduction molecules, surface structures such as adhesion
      molecules, and co-stimulators have been reported to increase in their
      expression and function. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents have
      greatly improved the outcome of acute diseases and 5-year survival rate.
      However, it is suggested that long-term survival and quality of life
      appears to be unsatisfactory. Although the medical management of SLE is
      not sufficient to warrant long-term survival of young patients, recent
      progress in anti-cytokine biologics therapy against rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) has facilitated searching for the molecular targets of SLE. In this
      report, we briefly review the molecular basis of SLE pathogenesis, and
      discuss possible therapeutic targets in this disease, focusing
      particularly on signal transduction and adhesion molecules in T cells.

TI  - Time dependency of walking classification in stroke.
PG  - 618-25
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To facilitate optimal stroke rehabilitation, valid
      interpretation of observed functional recovery is required. The purpose of
      this study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between
      comfortable walking speed and Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC)
      scores for physically independent gait. SUBJECTS: This study was a
      prospective cohort study with 73 subjects who were severely affected by
      acute stroke. METHODS: Functional Ambulation Categories classification and
      walking speed were measured between weeks 4 and 26 after stroke. The
      responsiveness of walking speed measurements for detecting clinically
      important speed changes was determined, and the longitudinal association
      between walking speed and FAC scores and its time dependency were
      established. This relationship subsequently was scrutinized for possible
      speed changes occurring within specific FAC scores. Responsiveness ratios,
      random coefficient analysis, paired Student t tests, and the Cohen kappa
      statistic were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Responsiveness
      ratios exceeded the smallest detectable differences. Random coefficient
      analysis demonstrated a significant between- and within-subject
      coefficient and a significant negative interaction between timing of
      measurements and FAC scores. Paired Student t tests revealed mostly
      significant pretest-posttest differences in walking speeds, and all kappa
      values for pretest-posttest FAC scores were significant. DISCUSSION AND
      CONCLUSION: Walking speed measurements are sensitive for detecting
      clinically important changes. Functional Ambulation Categories scores are
      dependent on the timing of comfortable walking speed measurements after
      stroke. Moreover, there are indications that, in this relationship,
      repeated FAC appraisals are not only based on steady walking speeds, but
      that the walking speeds related to a specific FAC appraisal also change
      and, over time, may shift gradually from higher to lower speeds.

TI  - Systematic review: Rabeprazole-based therapies in Helicobacter pylori
      eradication.
PG  - 751-64
AB  - AIM: To perform a systematic review of the efficacy of rabeprazole-based
      therapies in Helicobacter pylori eradication, and to conduct a
      meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of rabeprazole and other proton pump
      inhibitors when co-prescribed with antibiotics. METHODS: Studies
      evaluating rabeprazole plus antibiotics were considered. Only randomized
      trials comparing rabeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors with
      antibiotics, and differing only in the proton pump inhibitor, were
      included in the meta-analysis. Electronic and manual bibliographic
      searches were conducted. The percentage (weighted mean) of successful
      eradication was calculated. Meta-analysis was performed by combining the
      odds ratios (OR) of the individual studies. RESULTS: The eradication rates
      were as follows: 14-day rabeprazole-amoxicillin, 73%;
      rabeprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin for 3, 5, 7 and 10 days, 44%, 72%,
      78% and 75%, respectively; low-dose rabeprazole (20 mg/day), amoxicillin
      and clarithromycin for 7 days, 81%; high-dose rabeprazole (40 mg/day),
      amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 7 days, 75%; 7-day
      rabeprazole-clarithromycin-nitroimidazole, 85%. Twelve comparative studies
      were included in the meta-analysis. The eradication rate with rabeprazole
      plus antibiotics was 79%; it was 77% with other proton pump inhibitors (OR
      = 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-1.42). Sub-analysis comparing
      rabeprazole at low doses (10 mg b.d.) with other proton pump inhibitors at
      standard doses (omeprazole 20 mg b.d. or lansoprazole 30 mg b.d.) showed
      no differences. CONCLUSIONS: Rabeprazole achieves similar H. pylori
      eradication rates to omeprazole and lansoprazole when co-prescribed with
      antibiotics. Low doses of rabeprazole (10 mg b.d.), when administered with
      two antibiotics, may be sufficient to eradicate H. pylori infection.

TI  - [Is there a rationale for use of antibiotics in hair transplantation
      surgery?].
PG  - 7-10
AB  - Currently hair transplantation is the number one cosmetic surgical
      procedure in men. American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery (AACS) estimated
      that there were 177,000 hair transplantation sessions done in the year
      2000. As for other cutaneous surgery, various antibiotics are administered
      during hair transplantation to minimize complications. But the use of
      prophylactic antibiotics to avoid surgical side infection for clean
      surgical wounds remains controversial. Although antibiotic prophylaxis can
      decrease the incidence of surgical side infection, the benefits should be
      weighed against the risks of toxic and allergic reactions, dysbacteriosis,
      and the emergence of bacterial resistance. In any case most of surgeons
      routinely prescribe the use of antibiotics preoperatively (from 1 hour to
      2 days before the procedure) and postoperatively (range 5-7 days) for all
      patients. The objective of this work was the complete clinical observation
      for surgical side infection risk assessment during large hair transplant
      sessions which would help us to answer the question: should the antibiotic
      prophylaxis be used routinely in hair transplant procedures? Three groups
      of study subjects were defined: first group--100 patients who were
      operated in our clinic in 2002-2004 years. Number of transplanted FU per
      session varied between 350-4516 (average 1983+/-4,8). In this group
      antibiotics were not be administrated. Second group--100 patients who were
      operated in the same period with 2016+/-47 FU transplantation. In this
      group all patients received 1,0 gr. ceftriaxone (rocephin, Roche) before
      surgery and 1,0 gr. ceftriaxone every day after surgery during 5 days.
      Third group--342 patients who were operated during 1999-2002 years with
      transplantation of 420-3000 FU (average 1411+/-3,9) per session. In this
      group all patients received Duracef 500 mg (Bristol Mayers) twice per day
      after surgery during 1 week. Our observations demonstrated no accidents of
      surgical side infection or irritation of recipient side or central
      necrosis in first two groups. 7 cases of SSI and central necrosis were
      occurred in the third group, but the primary cause of these complications
      was due to the rough technique in creation of recipient sites (using N16
      Nokor needle) or donor closure. Analysis of our clinical observations
      which has been continued for 6 years and included 542 cases, assures us
      that prophylactic prescription of antibiotics after hair transplantation
      is unnecessary especially during strict adherence to the aseptic rules.

TI  - An integrated semicompliant balloon ultrasound catheter for quantitative
      feedback and image guidance during stent deployment.
PG  - 1498-503
AB  - An integrated balloon ultrasound catheter prototype was designed to image
      from inside the balloon for real-time guidance during stent deployment. It
      was fabricated using a semicompliant balloon material (polyethylene) and a
      20 MHz, 64-element circumferential ultrasound array. A commercial stent,
      nominally 4.4 mm in diameter and 12 mm in length, was used for a phantom
      study and placed along the length of the integrated balloon ultrasound
      catheter. A rubber phantom was created with an elastic modulus of 175 kPa
      with a 4.36 mm diameter lumen. Real-time balloon pressure measurements
      were recorded using a digital pressure sensor, and real-time
      radio-frequency (RF) data were captured as the balloon was inflated. The
      slope of the area-pressure ratio (APR) was compared to a reference measure
      of the balloon and stent expanded in water to determine a measure for
      optimal stent deployment. The results clearly indicate stent deployment at
      11.1 atm using this metric. The APR slope could serve as quantitative
      feedback parameter for guiding stent deployment to reduce arterial injury
      and subsequent restenosis. After the stent deployment experiment, RF data
      were captured as the balloon catheter was moved along the length of the
      stent in pullback mode to confirm successful stent deployment. Ultimately,
      an integrated balloon ultrasound catheter could serve as a single catheter
      intervention device by providing real-time intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
      imaging and quantitative feedback during stent deployment.

TI  - Prevalence of orofacial pain and treatment seeking in Hong Kong Chinese.
PG  - 218-25
AB  - AIMS: To estimate the prevalence and pattern of self-reported orofacial
      pain symptoms and treatment-seeking behavior in adult Cantonese-speaking
      Chinese people in Hong Kong. METHODS: A cross-sectional population survey
      involving a telephone survey technique was used to identify 1,222 randomly
      selected Cantonese-speaking people aged at least 18 years. Standard
      questions were asked on the experience of 8 orofacial pain symptoms in the
      previous month and on treatment-seeking behavior. RESULTS: Orofacial pain
      symptoms were reported by 41.6% of respondents when tooth sensitivity was
      included and by 24.2% when it was excluded. There was no gender- or
      age-related difference in pain prevalence (P > .010). Tooth sensitivity
      was the most common symptom (27.7%), followed by toothache (12.5%), and
      shooting pain in the face was the least common (1.1%). Almost half those
      with symptoms reported the pain as moderate to severe, and a fifth had
      frequent pain. Only 20.3% with pain symptoms sought professional
      treatment, and use of self-prescribed medication was very low (12.4%).
      CONCLUSION: Orofacial pain symptoms appear to affect more than a quarter
      of the adult population in Hong Kong, and prevalence estimates were
      consistent with those in Western countries. A substantial proportion of
      the pain symptoms were frequent and of moderate to severe intensity, with
      the potential for significant morbidity. Professional treatment seeking
      was very low and may be related to specific pain behaviors and effective
      coping strategies in this ethnic group.

TI  - Design and synthesis of labeled analogs of PhTX-56, a potent and selective
      AMPA receptor antagonist.
PG  - 5104-12
AB  - Polyamines and polyamine toxins are biologically important molecules,
      having modulatory effects on nucleotides and proteins. The wasp toxin,
      philanthotoxin-433 (PhTX-433), is a non-selective and uncompetitive
      antagonist of ionotropic receptors, such as ionotropic glutamate receptors
      and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Polyamine toxins are used for the
      characterization of subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, the
      Ca2+-permeable AMPA and kainate receptors. A derivative of the native
      polyamine toxin, philanthotoxin-56 (PhTX-56), has recently been shown to
      be an exceptionally potent and selective antagonist of Ca2+-permeable AMPA
      receptors. PhTX-56 and its labeled derivatives are promising tools for
      structure-function studies of the ion channel of the AMPA receptor. We now
      describe the design and synthesis of 3H-, 13C-, and 15N-labeled
      derivatives of PhTX-56 for molecular level studies of AMPA receptors.
      [3H]PhTX-56 was prepared from a diiodo-precursor with high specific
      radioactivity, providing the first radiolabeled ligand binding to the
      pore-forming part of AMPA receptors. For advanced biological NMR studies,
      13C and 15N-labeled PhTX-56 were synthesized using solid-phase synthesis.
      These analogs can provide detailed information on the ligand-receptor
      interaction. In conclusion, synthesis of labeled derivatives of PhTX-56
      provides important tools for future studies of the pore-forming region of
      AMPA receptors.

TI  - Correlation between clinical and histological findings in parathyroid
      tumors suspicious for carcinoma.
PG  - 419-26
AB  - Carcinoma of the parathyroid is a rare malignancy that can be cured
      surgically if the proper diagnosis and treatment is given initially.
      Arriving to the clinical suspicion of a malignancy preoperatively is by
      far the most important step for a good prognosis. Our goal is to review
      the correlation between clinical and final histopathological findings that
      can arouse the suspicion of such malignancy and their true predictive
      value in the diagnosis. All patients that underwent surgical removal of
      the parathyroid mass between March of 1992 and March of 2003 were reviewed
      retrospectively at Providence Hospital and Medical Centers. Among 168
      patients who underwent parathyroid excision, 14 (8.3%) had hyperplasia of
      the parathyroid, 121 (72%) had benign adenoma, 25 (14.8%) had other benign
      lesions, and 8 (4.7%) patients had primary carcinoma of the parathyroid
      confirmed by pathology. Our mean serum calcium level was 11.57 mg/dL,
      which was lower than the mean level (12 mg/dL) for benign
      hyperparathyroidism. The mean tumor size was 2.18 cm, smaller than the
      proposed for malignant criteria, and none of the eight patients (0%) had
      any symptoms of hypercalcemia at the time of diagnosis. Seven of eight
      patients (87.5%) had frank signs of invasion together with other
      histological features, and two patients had associated papillary carcinoma
      of the thyroid. Five patients from our series did not meet clinical
      criteria for malignancy (tumor size > 3 cm, palpable mass, and serum
      calcium > 14 mg/dL), but had undisputable histological findings (high
      mitotic pattern, fibrous trabeculae, capsular invasion, vascular invasion,
      and nodular involvement). On the other hand, 17 patients with benign
      histology had tumors greater than 3 cm, and an additional 18 had palpable
      masses on physical examination. We believe that these patients need to be
      followed closely. The patients with diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma,
      their kindred, and those with large adenomas may benefit from genetic
      screening for HRTP2 gene mutations in search of early detection of tumors
      suspicious for malignancy. This is based on the fact that we did not find
      correlation between the clinical presentation and the histological
      features in our patients with proven malignancy.

TI  - Clinical and epidemiological features of AIDS/tuberculosis comorbidity.
PG  - 207-14
AB  - Considering the relevance of AIDS/tuberculosis comorbidity worldwide,
      especially in Brazil, this study was developed to describe the clinical
      and epidemiological features of the comorbid cases identified from 1989 to
      1997 by the epidemiology service of the Hospital das Clinicas of the
      Universidade de Sao Paulo. METHODS: Databases containing information on
      all identified AIDS/tuberculosis cases cared for at the hospital were used
      to gather information on comorbid cases. RESULTS: During the period, 559
      patients were identified as presenting with AIDS/tuberculosis comorbidity.
      Risk behavior for AIDS was primarily heterosexual contact (38.9%),
      followed by intravenous drug use (29.3%) and homosexual/bisexual contact
      (23.2%). Regarding clinical features, there were higher rates of
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis when compared to tuberculosis without
      comorbidity. There was an increase in reporting of AIDS by ambulatory
      units during the period. Epidemiologically, there was a decrease in the
      male/female ratio, a predominance in the 20 to 39 year-old age group, and
      a majority of individuals who had less than 8 years of schooling and had
      low professional qualifications. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of
      AIDS/tuberculosis cases at our hospital indicate the need for better
      attention towards early detection of tuberculosis, especially in its
      extrapulmonary form. Since the population that attends this hospital tends
      to be of a lower socioeconomic status, better management of AIDS and
      tuberculosis is required to increase the rates of treatment adherence and
      thus lower the social costs.

TI  - Expression of interleukin-8 and its receptor IL-8RA in chronic
      hyperplastic candidosis.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neutrophils are the main opponents of Candida albicans in
      chronic hyperplastic candidosis. They migrate from the circulation to the
      epithelium where they form microabscesses. We therefore hypothesized that
      the neutrophil chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) might play a role in the
      neutrophil-Candida interaction. METHODS: Biopsies from patients with
      chronic hyperplastic candidosis (n = 10) were stained using the
      avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex protocol for IL-8 and IL-8 receptor A and
      were compared to healthy control mucosa (n = 3). A set of C. albicans agar
      sections was similarly analysed. RESULTS: In chronic hyperplastic
      candidosis lesions IL-8 was strongly expressed in both vascular
      endothelium and mucosal epithelium. Many resident and immigrant
      inflammatory cells, including intraepithelial neutrophils, were IL-8
      receptor A positive. In addition, IL-8 (or an analogue) was found in the
      candidal mother cell in chronic hyperplastic candidosis and in agar,
      whereas the tips of the hyphae expressed IL-8 receptor A (or an analogue).
      CONCLUSION: IL-8 may play a role in the recruitment of neutrophils from
      the vascular compartment to the epithelial microabscesses. C. albicans may
      have developed an ability to sense IL-8. The IL-8 ligand-receptor
      interaction may help to direct the growth of the IL-8-receptor-containing
      tips of the hyphae away from the IL-8-producing candidal cell body (a
      centrifugal growth pattern to facilitate host tissue penetration). Later,
      this ability might help to keep the vulnerable hyphal tips away from areas
      with high concentrations of host IL-8 and candidacidal neutrophils. We
      suggest that this phenomenon, in contrast to chemotropism, is named
      chemophobia.

TI  - Modulation of ADAMTS13 secretion and specific activity by a combination of
      common amino acid polymorphisms and a missense mutation.
PG  - 118-25
AB  - Sequence analysis of the ADAMTS13 locus of 2 patients with hereditary
      thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) revealed the homozygous presence
      of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (R7W, Q448E, P618A, A732V) and
      a rare missense mutation (R1336W). Analysis of the individual effect of
      any amino acid exchanges showed that several sequence variations can
      interact with each other, thereby altering the phenotype of ADAMTS13
      deficiency. Introduction of polymorphisms R7W, Q448E, and A732V had no or
      only minor effects on ADAMTS13 secretion. In contrast, P618A, R1336W, and
      the A732V-P618A combination strongly reduced ADAMTS13-specific activity
      and antigen levels. Surprisingly, R7W and Q448E were positive modifiers of
      ADAMTS13 secretion in the context of P618A and A732V but neither could
      rescue the severely reduced specific activity conferred by P618A. However,
      in the context of R1336W, polymorphisms R7W and Q448E enhanced the
      detrimental effect of the missense mutation and led to undetectable enzyme
      activity. We show that dependent on the sequence context, the same
      polymorphisms might be either positive or negative modifiers of gene
      expression. Our results might therefore be widely relevant to
      understanding the influence of polymorphisms on the phenotypic expression
      of complex diseases.

PG  - 1282-6
AB  - ISEcp1B has been reported to be associated with and to mobilize the

      ascorbata. Insertions of ISEcp1B upstream of the blaCTX-M-2 gene in K.
      ascorbata reference strain CIP7953 were first selected with cefotaxime
      (0.5 and 2 microg/ml). In those cases, ISEcp1B brought promoter sequences
      enhancing blaCTX-M-2 expression in K. ascorbata. Then, ISEcp1B-mediated
      mobilization of the blaCTX-M-2 gene from K. ascorbata to Escherichia coli
      J53 was attempted. The transposition frequency of ISEcp1B-blaCTX-M-2
      occurred at (6.4+/-0.5)x10(-7) in E. coli. Cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and
      piperacillin enhanced transposition, whereas amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and
      nalidixic acid did not. Transposition was also enhanced when studied at 40
      degrees C.

TI  - Screening of suitable immobilized metal chelates for adsorption of
      monoclonal antibodies against mutant amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
PG  - 340-7
AB  - The chromatographic behaviour of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of IgM class
      against mutant (T103I) amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
      investigated. The effect of ligand concentration, the length of spacer arm
      and the nature of metal ion were investigated on immobilized metal ion
      affinity chromatography (IMAC). MAbs against mutant amidase adsorbed to Cu
      (II), Ni (II), Zn (II), Co (II) and Ca (II)-IDA agarose columns. The
      adsorption of MAbs onto immobilized metal chelates was pH dependent
      because an increase in the binding of MAbs was observed as the pH was
      raised from 6.0 to 8.0. The adsorption of MAbs to metal chelates was due
      to coordination of histidine residues which are available in the 3rd
      constant domain of heavy chain (CH3) of immunoglobulins since the presence
      of imidazole in the equilibration buffer abolished the adsorption of MAbs
      to the column packed with commercial IDA-Zn(II) agarose at pH 8.0. The
      combination of tailor-made stationary phases for IMAC and a correct choice
      of the adsorption conditions permitted to design a one-step purification
      procedure for MAbs of IgM class. Culture supernatants containing MAbs of
      IgM class against mutant amidase (T103I) were chromatographed by IMAC Co
      (II) column at pH 8.0. The results strongly suggest that one-step
      purification of MAbs of IgM class by IMAC is a cost-effective and
      process-compatible alternative to the other purification procedures.

TI  - Blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptor diminishes cardiac hypertrophy,
      but does not abolish thyroxin-induced preconditioning.
PG  - 500-4
AB  - Growth and stress seem to share common intracellular pathways and
      activation of growth signaling can increase resistance to stress. Thyroid
      hormone induces cardiac hypertrophy and preconditions the myocardium
      against ischemia reperfusion injury. The present study investigated
      whether this response is mediated by renin-angiotensin system (RAS). RAS
      is shown to be activated in hyperthyroidism and is involved in the
      development of cardiac hypertrophy. Male Wistar rats were treated with
      L-thyroxin (25 microg/100 g, sc, od) for fourteen days, while normal rats
      served as controls. In addition, irbesartan (150 mg/kg po), a potent
      blocker of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1), was given with L-thyroxin
      for fourteen days. Isolated hearts were perfused in Langendorff mode;
      after stabilization, they were subjected to 20 min zero-flow global
      ischemia and 45 min of reperfusion. Thyroxin induced cardiac hypertrophy,
      which was diminished with irbesartan administration. Post-ischemic
      recovery of function was increased in thyroxin-treated hearts as compared
      to controls while ischemic contracture was accelerated and intensified.
      Irbesartan did not abolish this response. In conclusion, blockade of
      angiotensin II type 1 receptor with irbesartan preserves thyroxin-induced
      cardioprotection while diminishing cardiac hypertrophy. It is likely that
      thyroxin-induced cardioprotection is due to a direct effect of thyroid
      hormone.

TI  - Potato tuber isoapyrases: substrate specificity, affinity labeling, and
      proteolytic susceptibility.
PG  - 975-82
AB  - Apyrase/ATP-diphosphohydrolase hydrolyzes di- and triphosphorylated
      nucleosides in the presence of a bivalent ion with sequential release of
      orthophosphate. We performed studies of substrate specificity on
      homogeneous isoapyrases from two potato tuber clonal varieties: Desiree
      (low ATPase/ADPase ratio) and Pimpernel (high ATPase/ADPase ratio) by
      measuring the kinetic parameters K(m) and k(cat) on deoxyribonucleotides
      and fluorescent analogues of ATP and ADP. Both isoapyrases showed a broad
      specificity towards dATP, dGTP, dTTP, dCTP, thio-dATP, fluorescent
      nucleotides (MANT-; TNP-; ethene-derivatives of ATP and ADP). The
      hydrolytic activity on the triphosphorylated compounds was always higher
      for the Pimpernel apyrase. Modifications either on the base or the ribose
      moieties did not increase K(m) values, suggesting that the introduction of
      large groups (MANT- and TNP-) in the ribose does not produce steric
      hindrance on substrate binding. However, the presence of these bulky
      groups caused, in general, a reduction in k(cat), indicating an important
      effect on the catalytic step. Substantial differences were observed
      between potato apyrases and enzymes from various animal tissues,
      concerning affinity labeling with azido-nucleotides and FSBA
      (5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine). PLP-nucleotide derivatives were
      unable to produce inactivation of potato apyrase. The lack of sensitivity
      of both potato enzymes towards these nucleotide analogues rules out the
      proximity or adequate orientation of sulfhydryl, hydroxyl or amino-groups
      to the modifying groups. Both apyrases were different in the proteolytic
      susceptibility towards trypsin, chymotrypsin and Glu-C.

PG  - 631-6
AB  - Catalytic antibodies (CAbs) occur naturally in healthy individuals where
      they may form part of the innate immune system, but are preferentially
      found in those with autoimmune disease. CAbs can also be artificially
      engineered or elicited by immunizations. Their mechanisms of action
      include nucleophilic catalysis, induction of conformational strain,
      coordination with metal ions, and stabilization of transition states.
      Recent applications of CAbs with clinical significance include the
      conversion of cocaine to a non-psychoactive form, the degradation of
      nicotine, activation of prodrugs for targeted chemotherapy, protection
      from ultraviolet radiation, inhibition of HIV infectivity, and the
      destruction of aggregates of beta-amyloid implicated in Alzheimer's
      disease. Artificial CAbs are likely to find increasing applications in
      research, clinical medicine, diagnostics and manufacturing.

TI  - Noninvasive telemetric gaze tracking in freely moving socially housed
      prosimian primates.
PG  - 185-94
AB  - Behavioral and neurophysiological studies strongly suggest that visual
      orienting reflects the integration of sensory, motor, and motivational
      variables. Relatively little is known, however, regarding the goals that
      govern visual orienting of animals in their natural environments. Field
      observations suggest that most nonhuman primates orient to features of
      their natural environments whose salience is dictated by the visual
      demands of foraging, locomotion, and social interaction. This hypothesis
      is difficult to test quantitatively, however, in part because accurate
      gaze-tracking technology has not been employed in field studies. We here
      report the implementation of a new, telemetric, infrared-video
      gaze-tracker to measure visual orienting in freely moving, socially housed
      prosimian primates (Lemur catta). Two male lemurs tolerated the system at
      approximately 1/4 body weight, permitting successful measurements of gaze
      behavior during spontaneous locomotion through both terrestrial and
      arboreal landscapes, and in both social and asocial environments.

TI  - Septal repair implants: evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging safety at
      3 T.
PG  - 1021-5
AB  - Specialized implants are used for transcatheter closure of septal defects,
      including atrial and ventricular septal defects, and patent foramen ovale.
      These metallic devices may pose a risk to patients undergoing magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) procedures especially if performed at 3 T.
      Therefore, this investigation evaluated MRI safety at 3 T for septal
      repair implants (CardioSEAL Septal Repair Implant and STARFlex Septal
      Repair Implant, NMT Medical, Boston, MA, USA) by characterizing magnetic
      field interactions, heating and artifacts. These implants exhibited minor
      magnetic field interactions; heating was not excessive (+0.5 degrees C);
      and artifacts will only create a problem if the area of interest is in the
      same area as or near these devices. Thus, the findings indicated that it
      would be safe for a patient with these implants to undergo MRI at 3 T or
      lower. Importantly, because of the minor magnetic field interactions, MRI
      may be performed immediately after implantation.

TI  - Subventricular zone proliferation after
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-mediated
      neonatal brain injury.
PG  - 228-34
AB  - The mammalian forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) contains stem cells
      capable of generating new neurons and glia. Recent studies indicate that
      acute brain injury is a potent stimulus for SVZ stem cell proliferation.
      To better understand mechanisms of the SVZ response to neonatal brain
      injury, we used a model that focuses on a unique mechanism of
      vulnerability of the immature CNS,
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)
      receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. We previously demonstrated that
      intracerebroventricular injection of the glutamate analog AMPA in rats at
      postnatal day 7 (P7) caused bilateral periventricular gray and white
      matter injury. We hypothesized that excitotoxic injury would stimulate
      cellular proliferation in the SVZ; we used the AMPA
      intracerebroventricular injection model to test this hypothesis. P7 rat
      pups received either left or right intracerebroventricular injections of
      S-AMPA (2.5 nmol). Normal and PBS-injected littermates were included as
      controls. On P8 or P14, serial coronal sections through the SVZ were
      collected; an immunohistochemical assay was performed with an antibody to
      the cell proliferation marker Ki-67. Bilateral Ki-67+ cells/SVZ were
      quantitated stereologically using the optical disector method. The median
      number of Ki-67+ cells/SVZ was increased in the SVZ of AMPA-injected rats
      relative to normal controls on both P8 and P14. To evaluate neurogenesis,
      we assayed the expression of doublecortin, a microtubular protein
      expressed only by immature neurons. From P8 to P14, there was a marked
      increase in doublecortin immunoreactive cells in the AMPA-injected SVZ.
      Many Ki-67+ nuclei were immediately surrounded by doublecortin staining.
      This study indicates that there is a proliferative response in the
      immature SVZ after an excitotoxic stimulus. Our findings suggest that some
      of these newly generated cells differentiate as immature neurons. This
      model may provide information about the mechanisms that regulate SVZ
      responses to neonatal brain injury.

TI  - [The influence of c-Myc, Ki-67, MMP-2 and VEGF expression on the prognosis
      of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with tumor resection].
PG  - 660-2
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the effect of c-Myc, Ki-67, MMP-2 and VEGF
      expression on prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who had
      tumor resection. METHODS: Primary HCC patients who underwent tumor
      resection were retrospectively analyzed. The maximum size of their
      mononodular tumors was less than 5 cm, and no intrahepatic arterial
      chemotherapy was performed before the resections. They were followed up
      after resection and the time of recurrence was recorded. They were divided
      into 2 groups: group A (15 cases): tumor recurred within 1 year after
      tumor resection; group B (15 cases): with tumor recurrence after 2 years
      or without it. Paraffin sections of the tumors were remade from their old
      blocks. Immunohistochemistry stainings were performed with c-Myc, Ki-67,
      MMP-2 and VEGF monoclonal antibodies. Staining intensity of the tumor and
      paracancer tissues was quantitatively analyzed. RESULTS: c-Myc, Ki-67,
      MMP-2 and VEGF expressing intensities in cancer tissues in group A were
      higher than those in group B, and their expressed intensities in
      paracancer tissue in group A and B were not significantly different.
      CONCLUSION: The expressions of c-Myc, Ki-67, MMP-2 and VEGF in cancer
      tissues of the patients are related to the recurrence of their HCC after
      tumor resection.

      2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose/dual-head coincidence gamma camera
      imaging.
PG  - 220-8
AB  - Before studying the impact of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)
      imaging with a dual-head coincidence gamma camera (DHC) for the follow-up
      of animal tumor models, we wanted to optimize this technique. METHODS:
      Three different animal tumor models (osteosarcoma, melanoma, and breast
      cancer) were studied after FDG injection. Dynamic and dual time point
      FDG/DHC imaging were studied from one hour to five hours postinjection. In
      vitro tumor cell FDG uptake was assessed in eight different tumor cell
      lines. In one model (osteosarcoma), tumor growth, lung metastasis
      emergence, and survival were assessed by classical clinical follow-up and
      compared to FDG imaging in a control group (n = 6) and in a group treated
      by endostatin liposome complexes (n = 6). RESULTS: Images obtained five
      hours after injection were more reliable for tumor growth follow-up than
      standard images (one hour). In vitro tumor cell FDG uptake confirmed in
      vivo imaging studies. In eight different tumor cell lines the FDG uptake
      was higher after five hours incubation than after one hour (p < 0.002).
      With FDG follow-up, we found that FDG uptake was strongly correlated with
      survival and that lung metastasis larger than 5 mm could be detected.
      CONCLUSION: Using the optimization proposed above, DHC/FDG functional
      imaging seems to be a powerful tool to study rat tumor models and to help
      develop novel cancer therapies.

TI  - Ipsapirone and ketanserin protects against circulatory shock, intracranial
      hypertension, and cerebral ischemia during heatstroke.
PG  - 336-40
AB  - We assess the effects of ipsapirone (a 5-HT1A receptor agonist),
      ketanserin (a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist), (-)-pindolol (a 5-HT1A receptor
      antagonist), and DOI (a 5-HT2A receptor agonist) on heatstroke in a rat
      model. Animals, under urethane anesthesia, were exposed to high ambient
      temperature of 42 degrees C until mean arterial pressure and local
      cerebral blood flow in the striatum began to decrease, which was
      arbitrarily defined as the onset of heatstroke. Normothermic controls were
      exposed to room temperature of 24 degrees C. In rats treated with normal
      saline immediately before the initiation of heat stress, the values for
      survival time were found to be 21 to 25 min. Systemic administration of
      ipsapirone (10 mg/kg) or ketanserin (2 mg/kg) immediately before the
      initiation of heat stress significantly increased the survival time to new
      values of 92 to 104 min. Combined treatment with ipsapirone and ketanserin
      had additive effects (survival time of 156-194 min). In contrast, systemic
      administration of (-)-pindolol (2 mg/kg) or DOI (2 mg/kg) significantly
      decreased the survival time to new values of 2 to 3 min. In
      vehicle-treated heatstroke rats, the values for core temperature,
      intracranial pressure, and the extracellular levels of cellular ischemia
      (e.g., glutamate and lactate/pyruvate ratio) or damage (e.g., glycerol)
      markers and neuronal damage scores in striatum were significantly higher
      than those of normothermic controls. On the other hand, the values for
      mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral blood flow,
      and brain partial pressure of O2 were significantly lower than those of
      normothermic controls. The heatstroke-induced hyperthermia, arterial
      hypotension, intracranial hypertension, cerebral hypoperfusion and
      hypoxia, and increased levels of cellular ischemia and damage markers in
      striatum were all significantly attenuated by prior administration of
      ipsapirone or ketanserin. The present results strongly suggest that
      previous activation of 5-HT1A receptors or antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors
      protects against heatstroke by reducing circulatory shock and cerebral
      ischemia, whereas prior antagonism of 5-HT1A receptors or activation of
      5-HT2A receptors exacerbates heatstroke.

TI  - The phenomenology of meditation for female survivors of intimate partner
      violence.
PG  - 501-18
AB  - An existential-phenomenological methodology was utilized to investigate
      the experience of meditation for female survivors of intimate partner
      violence. Six coresearchers were taught a form of concentrative meditation
      and were asked to meditate daily and to attend a weekly group meditation
      for 6 weeks. Semistructured interviews were utilized to gather the data.
      The essence of the experience that was revealed was the emergence of a
      centered awareness that is distinctly different from the usual mode of
      being in the world. Findings suggest the value of meditation as an
      intervention strategy with survivors and demonstrate the need for further
      research in this area.

TI  - Acute depletion of murine primordial follicle reserve by
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists.
PG  - 1333-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of GnRH antagonists on preantral
      follicle survival in vivo and to investigate whether GnRH antagonist use
      during cyclophosphamide treatment would protect the ovary and preserve
      primordial follicle survival in a murine model. DESIGN: Prospective basic
      research study. SETTING: Research laboratory in an academic medical
      center. ANIMAL(S): Adult C57Bl/6 mice (5 to 6 weeks old). INTERVENTION(S):
      Mice received either a single injection of GnRH agonist (leuprolide
      acetate) on study day -10 or injections of the GnRH antagonist (antide or
      cetrorelix) on study days -3 and 0. Some animals also received the
      chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide on day 0. All animals were killed
      by CO2 asphyxiation on day 7. To examine direct vs. indirect effects, some
      mice received GnRH antagonist under the bursa of one ovary, with the
      contralateral ovary receiving vehicle. Ovaries were fixed in Kahle's
      solution; 7-mum tissue sections were stained with Lillie's allochrome, and
      preantral follicles were counted on every fifth section. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE(S): Numbers of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles.
      RESULT(S): Systemic administration of both GnRH antagonists caused a
      significant destruction of primordial follicles compared with control
      mice. Similar results were obtained whether the antagonists were
      administered systemically or directly to the ovary. Gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone agonist had no effect on primordial follicle numbers by itself but
      reduced the follicular depletion caused by cyclophosphamide.
      CONCLUSION(S): In contrast to the effects of GnRH agonists to reduce
      chemotherapeutic destruction of primordial follicles, GnRH antagonists do
      not protect the ovary from the damaging effects of cyclophosphamide. More
      importantly, GnRH antagonists alone deplete primordial follicles in this
      murine model, likely through a direct effect on the ovary. Whether these
      observations apply to other species requires further study.

TI  - Recruited inflammatory cells mediate endotoxin-induced lung maturation in
      preterm fetal lambs.
PG  - 1315-21
AB  - RATIONALE: Chorioamnionitis is paradoxically associated with a decreased
      incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. In preterm
      lambs, intraamniotic endotoxin and interleukin 1 (IL-1) induce lung
      inflammation followed by lung maturation. OBJECTIVE: To test if
      inflammatory cells are required to mediate induced lung maturation.
      METHODS: Lung inflammation was induced by intraamniotic injection of
      endotoxin or IL-1. Inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung was inhibited
      by an anti-CD18 blocking antibody given intramuscularly to the fetus.
      Preterm lambs were delivered at 124-d gestation (term = 150 d) 2 or 7 d
      after exposure to endotoxin/IL-1 or endotoxin/IL-1 + anti-CD18 antibody.
      MEASUREMENTS: Lung inflammation was measured by bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid cell count, inflammatory scoring of lung parenchyma, and expression
      of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Lung
      maturation was quantitated by surfactant protein mRNA expression,
      saturated phosphatidylcholine pool size, and pressure-volume curves. MAIN
      RESULTS: Inhibition of CD18 significantly reduced endotoxin-induced but
      not IL-1-induced fetal lung inflammatory cell recruitment and activation
      as well as expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Compared with control
      lungs, both endotoxin and IL-1 induced lung maturation. Anti-CD18 antibody
      administration inhibited only endotoxin-induced but not IL-1-induced
      increases in surfactant protein mRNA and surfactant saturated
      phosphatidylcholine. Exposure to anti-CD18 antibody moderated
      endotoxin-induced increases in lung volumes but had no effect on
      IL-1-induced increases in lung volumes. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Endotoxin- but
      not IL-1-induced inflammatory cell recruitment in the preterm fetal lamb
      lung is CD18 dependent; (2) recruited inflammatory cells mediate some
      aspects of fetal lung maturation.

TI  - Sex differences in the relation of body composition to markers of
      inflammation.
PG  - 216-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that low-grade systemic inflammation is
      associated with obesity and that this association might be modified by
      sex. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis among
      641 men and 597 women aged 55-74 years who participated in the
      population-based KORA Survey 2000, conducted in the area of Augsburg,
      Germany. Measures of both total (fat mass, body mass index) and abdominal
      adiposity (waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR)) were highly
      correlated with markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein
      (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen (FIB), interleukin-6 (IL-6)) in
      men and in women. Significant associations persisted when the effect of
      lifestyle factors was taken into account. In multivariable linear
      regression analysis, a considerably higher percentage of variability in
      inflammatory markers was explained by body composition in women compared
      to men. Furthermore, the relevance of single body composition variables
      varied by sex. In women, fat mass in % explained the highest percentage of
      the variability of circulating acute-phase proteins (18.2% for CRP, 7.2%
      for SAA, 6.1% for FIB, all p-values < 0.001), whereas in men, WHR
      explained the highest percentage of the variability (6.2% for CRP, 2.3%
      for SAA, 1.8% for FIB, all p-values < 0.001). For IL-6, WC explained the
      highest percentage of the variability in women (3.7%, p < 0.001) and in
      men (1.8%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Adiposity is strongly associated with
      low-grade systemic inflammation in men and in women but the association is
      considerably stronger in women, especially for CRP. Thus, weight reduction
      as a means to prevent a state of subclinical inflammation might be
      particularly effective in women.

TI  - Chronic di-n-butyl phthalate exposure in rats reduces fertility and alters
      ovarian function during pregnancy in female Long Evans hooded rats.
PG  - 189-95
AB  - Testis function in fetal and peripubertal male rats is disrupted by
      subchronic exposure to phthalate esters (PEs). In contrast to the male
      rat, it is generally held that reproduction in female rats is much less
      sensitive to phthalate-induced disruption. However, the current study
      demonstrates that oral administration of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) to female
      Long Evans (LE) hooded rats from weaning, through puberty, mating, and
      gestation disrupts pregnancy maintenance at dose levels similar to those
      that affect testis function in male rats. Administration of 500 and 1000
      mg DBP/kg/day, but not 250 mg DBP/kg/day, to female LE rats induced
      midpregnancy abortions. The percentage of females delivering live pups was
      reduced by more than 50% at 500 mg/kg/day and by 90% at 1000 mg/kg/day in
      the absence of overt toxicity, whereas the ages at vaginal opening and
      first estrus, estrous cyclicity, and mating indices (N mated/N paired or N
      pregnant/N mated) were not significantly affected. On gestational day 13,
      prior to the stage when litters were being aborted, ex vivo ovarian
      hormone production was significantly decreased by in vivo DBP treatment at
      500 and 1000 mg/kg/day. These results should be considered when evaluating
      mechanisms of reproductive toxicity for the PE because it is likely that
      these reproductive alterations in the female rat arise via a mode of
      action similar to that operative in male rats.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects of candesartan in hypertensive
      patients.
PG  - 96-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker therapy prevented
      or retarded the progression of coronary heart disease. The mechanisms of
      this benefit may relate to the ability of AT1 receptor blockers to reduce
      inflammation and insulin resistance. METHODS: We administered placebo or
      candesartan 16 mg daily during 2 months to 45 patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension. This study was randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover in design. RESULTS: Candesartan therapy
      significantly lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared
      with placebo, candesartan therapy significantly lowered plasma hsCRP
      levels relative to baseline measurements from 1.10 to 0.70 mg/l (P=0.024)
      and soluble CD40 ligand levels by 30+/-11% (P<0.001). There were
      significant inverse correlations between body mass index and baseline
      plasma adiponectin levels (r=-0.480, P=0.009). There were significant
      correlations between baseline adiponectin levels and baseline insulin
      (r=-0.317, P=0.034) or baseline Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check
      Index (QUICKI), a surrogate index of insulin sensitivity (r=0.371,
      P=0.012). Compared with placebo, candesartan therapy significantly lowered
      fasting insulin levels (P=0.011) and increased plasma levels of
      adiponectin by 15+/-4% (P=0.012) and increased QUICKI by 8+/-2% (P=0.007).
      There were significant correlations between percent changes in adiponectin
      levels and percent changes in insulin (r=-0.340, P=0.022) or QUICKI
      (r=0.325, P=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Candesartan therapy significantly reduced
      inflammation and increased adiponectin levels and improved insulin
      sensitivity in hypertensive patients.
