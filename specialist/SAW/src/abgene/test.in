TI  - Analysis of the insulin gene in noninsulin-dependent diabetes.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - That diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin deficiency
      is well known. However, the nature and cause of this insulin lack are
      still to be determined. Recently devised analytical methods, resulting
      from recombinant DNA technology, have enabled us to study the process of
      insulin production in man and in experimental animals. The results of
      these studies suggest that the insulin-secretory defect in diabetes may be
      secondary to impaired synthesis.

AB  - Low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice serves as a model of type
      I diabetes. Suppression of the development of diabetes (hyperglycemia) in
      C3H/He mice was achieved with in vivo administration of antibody reactive
      to Ir-gene products before streptozotocin treatment. A persistent effect
      was reached with two monoclonal antibodies directed against I-Ak gene
      products and, surprisingly, by an allo-antiserum to I-J determinants.
      These results suggest a role for I-A and I-J positive T-lymphocytes and/or
      macrophages in B-islet cell autoimmunity.

      and the insulin-gene-linked polymorphism.
PG  - 13-7
AB  - Genetic factors play a major role in predisposition to diabetes in the
      Micronesian population of Nauru. In people aged 60 years and older, 83% of
      full-blooded Nauruans were diabetic compared with 17% of those with
      ancestral foreign admixture, as detected by HLA typing. HLA distributions
      also showed a small increased risk for early onset of diabetes (less than
      46 years) associated with HLA-Bw22 (Bw56). Variation in the restriction
      fragment length of DNA near the insulin gene was found, but was not
      associated with diabetes. The distribution in fragment lengths, previously
      reported in Caucasoids, was observed in healthy Polynesians, Melanesians
      and Micronesians.

TI  - Polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the human insulin gene and the
      incidence of diabetes.
PG  - 193-200
AB  - DNA length polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the human insulin
      gene has been reported by Bell et al. (1981), Rotwein et al. (1981), and
      Owerbach and Nerup (1982). Bgl I digestions of human DNA that have been
      hybridized to an insulin probe using the Southern technique shows that
      there are two distinct groups of 5'-flanking lengths: one being shorter
      than 3.6 kilobases (kb) and the other being longer than 4.3 kb. The
      insulin genes with the former length are denoted as A1, and those with the
      latter as A2. Using these data and demographic data of diabetes, it is
      estimated that, when the fitness of A1 A2 individual was taken as unity,
      the amounts of fitness reduction for A1 A1 was 6.5 X 10(-6) and that for
      A2 A2 was -5.6 X 10(-6). Because of these small magnitudes of selection,
      the changes in population incidences of insulin-dependent diabetes and
      noninsulin-dependent diabetes are not affected much by the polymorphism in
      the 5'-flanking region of the insulin gene.

AB  - Maturity onset diabetes of the young is inherited as an autosomal dominant
      condition. Two families with the disease were studied to determine whether
      the inheritance of this type of diabetes was linked to the insulin gene. A
      cloned insulin gene probe was hybridised to DNA from the family members
      and the insulin gene on each chromosome identified by a different fragment
      length polymorphism. The results showed no linkage between the insulin
      gene and the inheritance of maturity onset diabetes of the young.

TI  - Polymorphism in the 5' flanking region of the human insulin gene: a
      genetic marker for non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
PG  - 65-71
AB  - We sought to determine whether differences in the human insulin gene or
      its immediate flanking sequences could be found in diabetes. Peripheral
      leukocyte DNA from 217 unrelated persons, including blacks, whites, and
      Pima Indians, was analyzed by restriction-enzyme digestion, blotting to
      nitrocellulose filters, and hybridization to cloned [32P]insulin-gene
      probes. A region of length variation including deletions (0.1 to 0.2
      kilobase pairs) or insertions (0.6 to 5.5 kb) of DNA was found only in the
      immediate 5' flanking region in 33 per cent of the genes examined. A
      1.6-kb insertion accounted for 80 per cent of the polymorphism. This
      variant was found more often in subjects with non-insulin-dependent
      diabetes than in nondiabetics, regardless of race (P = 0.011). Length
      polymorphism in the 5' flanking region of the insulin gene may provide a
      genetic marker for non-insulin-dependent diabetes.

TI  - Gene technology, characterization of insulin gene and the relationship to
      diabetes research.
PG  - 197-209
AB  - The development and introduction of modern molecular biological methods
      was a prerequisite to the characterization of the insulin gene. The
      transfer of chemically synthesized genes for human insulin A and B chains
      as well as the naturally occurring rat insulin gene into bacteria opened
      possibilities to produce insulin in bacterial systems. Moreover, the
      structure of rat I and rat II insulin genes as well as human insulin gene
      were determined. Structural analysis of human insulin genes isolated from
      a human chromosomal gene library led to the identification of allelic
      variants of a single human insulin gene. The human insulin gene is located
      on the short arm of chromosome 11. The hypothesis that structurally
      abnormal insulin could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus
      could be proved in clinical practice. Human insulin isolated from a
      diabetic patient showed an abnormality in the amino acid sequence and a
      decreased biological activity of the hormone. This finding demonstrates
      that in certain cases of diabetes mellitus the synthesis of structurally
      abnormal insulin due to a mutation in the insulin gene can be the cause
      for the development of relative insulin deficiency and hyperglycaemia.

TI  - Genetics of Type I diabetes mellitus: a single, recessive predisposition
      gene mapping between HLA-B and GLO. With an appendix on the estimation of
      selection bias.
PG  - 865-82
AB  - Three different published sets of HLA-typed families of juvenile diabetes
      mellitus (JDM) patients have been analyzed. There was no significant
      genetic heterogeneity between them according to the criterion of Morton,
      and the total material was analyzed on the assumption of a single
      recessive (JDM-P) gene with incomplete penetrance. The analysis, carried
      out with the NYLIP program modified to account for penetrance less than 1
      and for selection bias, yields highly significant lod scores for linkage
      between HLA and JDM-P, with a maximum value of 7.40 at theta = .05 +/-
      .03. The segregation of HLA and GLO in five affected sib pairs, in which
      one of the sibs carries an HLA/GLO recombinant, places JDM-P closer to HLA
      than the GLO locus: four of these five pairs are HLA-identical and
      GLO-different, in agreement with the conclusions of the formal linkage
      analysis. The data from these three independent sets of families are
      therefore consistent with our earlier claim that JDM is inherited as a
      recessive trait closely linked to HLA with reduced penetrance, and its
      analysis does not require more complicated genetic models.

PG  - 1117-20
AB  - The arrangement of the human insulin gene in DNA from 87 individuals was
      analyzed by the Southern blot hybridization technique with a cloned
      genomic human insulin probe. Insertions of 1.5 to 3.4 kilobase pairs in
      the 5'-flanking region of the gene were found in DNA from 38 individuals.
      These insertions occurred within 1.3 kilobase pairs of the transcription
      initiation site. In contrast, no insertions were observed in the region 3'
      to the coding sequence. The prevalence of these insertions in type 2
      diabetes was significantly greater than in the other groups (P less than
      .001). The limitation of this striking length polymorphism to a potential
      promoter region suggests that these insertions may play a role in insulin
      gene expression.

TI  - Type I (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus. Is there strong evidence for
      a non-HLA linked gene?
PG  - 524-9
AB  - A recent investigation of families containing two and three consecutive
      generations affected with Type I (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus has
      led to speculation that there is a second susceptibility gene, not linked
      to the major histocompatibility complex. These families differ in
      important respects from families which have provided the strongest
      evidence for HLA linkage, namely, families with two or more affected
      siblings. Computer simulations were designed to test the hypothesis that
      these two types of families were drawn from the same population of insulin
      dependent patients. The results indicate that this hypothesis is tenable
      and that the consecutive generation families probably failed to yield
      strong evidence for an HLA linked susceptibility gene because of
      ascertainment bias combined with probable incorrect specifications of the
      mode of inheritance of insulin dependent diabetes.

TI  - Gene dosage and suceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes.
PG  - 135-50
AB  - 1. All members of 33 families in which two or more sibs have
      insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were HLA-typed. The results
      strongly support the hypothesis that, closely linked to the HLA region,
      there is a locus (S) for susceptibility to IDDM. We use Sd for alleles at
      this locus which confer susceptibility to disease, and Sa for all other
      alleles. 2. Published prevalence (recurrence) rates for relatives of an
      IDDM proband, which are essential for the analysis, are reviewed
      critically, and a new estimate of prevalence at age 30 in the general
      population is calculated from published data. 3. The analysis allows for
      greater risk (penetrance) of the genotype SdSd (two doses of Sd) than of
      SaSd (one dose of Sd) and for recombination between the HLA region and S.
      With either our own data on 26 affected sib pairs or a much larger sample
      assembled by pooling with published data, the maximum-likelihood estimate
      of the two-dose penetrance is 71%, of the one dose penetrance 6.5%. The
      hypothesis of differential penetrance according to gene dosage provides a
      significantly better explanation than either simple dominant or simple
      recessive inheritance. 4. Estimates of the recombination fraction between
      HLA and S are very sensitive to the proportion of affected sib pairs
      sharing neither HLA haplotype, which varies considerably among the samples
      pooled. With the pooled data the recombination fraction is estimated as
      3%, but in view of the strong associations with particular HLA alleles
      seen in population data, this should probably be considered an upper
      limit.

TI  - Influence of the murine diabetes gene on rubidium ion efflux from
      perifused islets.
PG  - 45-9
AB  - Islets from diabetic C57BL/KsJ db/db mice and normal C57BL/KsJ +/+ mice
      were loaded with 86Rb+ and micro-perfused with nonradioactive medium for
      25 min. The appearance of 86Rb+ in the effluent could be described as the
      sum of two exponential functions with difference proportionality
      constants. The rapid efflux component may have represented washout from
      the extracellular space, and had about the same proportionality constant
      in normal and diabetic mice. The slow efflux component probably reflected
      efflux across the islet cell plasma membranes. At 3 mmol/l D-glucose in
      the medium, the slow efflux was significantly retarded in diabetic as
      compared with normal mice. In normal mice, but not in diabetics, 20 mmol/l
      D-glucose inhibited the slow efflux component. It is concluded that the
      basal K+ permeability is decreased in KsJ db/db mouse islet cells, and
      that this abnormality may explain their persistant depolarization at low
      glucose concentrations.

TI  - Is juvenile diabetes determined by a single gene closely linked to HLA?
PG  - 527-32
AB  - The transmission behavior of insulin-dependent juvenile diabetes mellitus
      (JDM) has been studied with respect to its frequency in the relatives of
      JDM probands and its possible linkage to the HLA complex. Mathematical
      analysis shows that under a single locus hypothesis a very restricted
      range of incidence rates is possible in the full siblings of probands once
      the concordance rate in monozygotic (MZ) twins is specified. Specifically,
      for a given population prevalence of the disease, high concordance rates
      in MZ twins require high incidence rates in siblings, and low rates
      require low incidence rates, if a single locus model is th be valid.
      Moreover, if these rates do conform to a single locus model, then they
      give additional information about possible linkage between the purported
      JDM susceptibility gene and the HLA complex. By using observations on the
      identity by descent scores at the HLA locus of sibling pairs, both of whom
      are affected with JDM, it is shown that tight linkage of a disease
      susceptibility locus is possible only when the MZ twin and sibling
      incidence rates are low, whereas high rates support loose linkage. If the
      single locus model is rejected, then an alternative hypothesis, involving
      epistasis between a JDM susceptibility locus and genes in (or close to)
      the HLA complex can be suggested as a mechanism whereby JDM would appear
      to be linked to HLA within families while maintaining an association with
      HLA at the population level.

PG  - 141-8
AB  - An analysis of HLA-linked genetical factors conferring susceptibility to
      IDDM is reported. On the basis of population and family studies a
      recessive mode of inheritance of disease susceptibility provided by an
      assumption of HLA-B8-linked DS gene was observed. The characteristic
      component of the immunogenetical background was the high frequency of
      HLA-B8 (0.208) and the HLA-A1, B8 haplotype (0.134) (linkage
      disequilibrium D = 0.1031), reminiscent of that found also in other
      disorders with autoimmune features, such as Graves disease, SLE, etc.
      Considering the HLA-B8 and IDDM association, the DS gene frequency (pD =
      0.25) was estimated and the gametic association between HLA-B8 andu DS
      gene was calculated. The low value of penetrancy (4.8%) revealed the
      important role of non-HLA-linked genetical and environmental factors. The
      HLA-linked genetic factors in question might be responsible for an
      inclination to several kinds of autoimmune disorders.

TI  - Genetics of juvenile diabetes mellitus. A recessive gene closely linked to
      HLA D and with 50 per cent penetrance.
PG  - 1036-40
AB  - We investigated the genetic predisposition to juvenile diabetes in the
      families of 31 index cases in relation to the inheritance of the HLA
      system. The diabetes-predisposing gene was found to be recessive because
      the diabetic sibs in index cases shared both their HLA genes with a
      significantly increased frequency. Penetrance was estimated at 50 per cent
      because half the HLA-identical sibs in index cases were diabetic. These
      conclusions fit with published observations that the risk to sibs of
      patients is about 100 per cent, when both parents are normal. In three
      informative cases of recombination within HLA the predisposing gene
      traveled with the HLA D segment of the recombinant haplotype. We prepared
      tables for the computation of risks to relatives, based on the hypothesis
      of recessivity, HLA linkage and 50 per cent penetrance.

TI  - The importance of HLA genes to susceptibility in the development of

      blood relations.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - The importance of genetically determined antigens of the HLA system in
      etiology and pathogenesis of juvenile onset diabetes (JOD) was studied in
      93 JOD-patients and 68 blood relations. A close association was found
      between JOD and B-locus antigens B8 and Bw15, and C-locus antigen Cw3.
      Patients positive for one of these antigens have a 2-3 times -- and those
      positive for both B8 and Bw15 -- a 8.6 times greater chance of developing
      JOD, Evidence for a genetic heterogeneity between childhood type and later
      onset JOD could be obtained. B8 seems to play a particularly important
      role in childhood-type diabetes, whereas in the later onset JOD the
      antigens Cw3 and/or Bw15 might possibly represent an additional
      predisposing factor. Family studies have revealed a close correlation
      between glucose intolerance and those genes associated with JOD in blood
      relations below age 35. HLA-B7 which could be detected in that group of
      blood relations, and which was found statistically decreased in JODs might
      even exert some protective role. Incidence of haplotye identity in glucose
      intolerant siblings was almost three times higher than expected. These
      data provide evidence for the existence of a genetic basis which
      determines the susceptibility to develop JOD.

TI  - HLA-linked genes and islet-cell antibodies in diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1565-7
AB  - In a random series of 139 insulin-dependent diabetics aged 30 or under at
      the onset of disease islet-cell antibody (ICA) was detected in 33 cases
      (24%). In 27 patients who had had diabetes for less than one year 16 (59%)
      had ICA. Only one out of 51 patients with maturity onset diabetes who were
      not dependent on insulin were positive for ICA. Four out of 19 patients
      with late onset insulin-dependent diabetes had ICA. There was no
      association between the presence of ICA and any particular HLA phenotype.
      Within families containing two or more HLA haploidentical siblings with
      juvenile onset diabetes ICA was a variable finding both in its occurrence
      and in its relation to the duration of disease. A possible mode of action
      for the HLA-linked gene may be to permit a rapid immunological destructive
      process, possibly associated with viral infection.

PG  - 119-24
AB  - A model of intermediate inheritance of diabetes mellitus is given,
      according to which juvenile diabetes developes in persons homozygous for
      the mutant gene, and a part of heterozygous carrier of the mutant gene has
      late diabetes mellitus. A large group of diabetes cases (about 50%), which
      are not due to direct diabetes heredity, is taken into account.
      Calculations are carried out on the basis of Hardy-Weinberg law from the
      patient questionaire data. The frequency of juvenile diabetes (developing
      within first thirty years) is 0,028% in the Leningrad population, the
      frequency of heterozygous diabetes gene carrier being 3,28%. Penetrancy of
      the diabetes gene in heterozygous state, as estimated from registrable
      (clinically expressed) forms of the disease, is 8,4%. The risk of juvenile
      diabetes in children, if one of the parents has juvenile diabetes, is
      1,65% (3,3%-1/2), the frequency of heterozygous carriers in the population
      being 3,3%. The analysis of questionaire data of diabetes patients
      produced results, which were close to expected and indirectly confirmed
      the accurancy of the model proposed.

TI  - Evidence for HL-A-linked genes in "juvenile" diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 133-5
AB  - HL-A typing of 150 patients who had developed diabetes mellitus by the age
      of 30 years showed a significant association with HL-A 8 and W 15. The
      HL-A genotypes were determined in 17 families in which two or more
      siblings had this type of diabetes. The zygotic assortment of HL-A
      haplotypes was found to be significantly disturbed from the expected
      random pattern, with a reduction in the number of siblings showing no
      identical haplotypes and an appreciable increase in the number with both
      haplotypes identical. This appears to be most consistent with the presence
      of a gene or genes pre-disposing to this type of diabetes at a locus
      closely linked to the HL-A chromosomal loci. This locus appears to have a
      fundamental role in the susceptibility to juvenile diabetes.
